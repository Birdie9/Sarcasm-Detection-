ManndaMichelle,Fri Aug 30 22:21:13 IST 2013,Why can't I just have normal dreams with people I'm actually friends with?
ManndaMichelle,Fri Aug 30 22:20:54 IST 2013,"Seeing someone's tweets and remembering they were in your dream, and having it all flood back to you, so weird."
ManndaMichelle,Fri Aug 30 13:28:21 IST 2013,Unfollowing my best friend's recent asshole of an ex because I clearly have the maturity of a 16 year old #sorrynotsorry #zerofucksgiven
ManndaMichelle,Fri Aug 30 10:29:41 IST 2013,Just tried opening my front door with the wrong key for a solid minute. Seconds from frustration tears I realized it wasn't the right key...

ManndaMichelle,Wed Aug 28 14:17:22 IST 2013,"@andrewkealoha sure dude! I have tentative plans with a ton if people, but if you remind me occasionally I'll keep you at #1 :)"
ManndaMichelle,Wed Aug 28 14:15:29 IST 2013,@andrewkealoha oh always my love!😘
ManndaMichelle,Wed Aug 28 14:14:49 IST 2013,@andrewkealoha oh dude I've got you covered
ManndaMichelle,Wed Aug 28 14:11:34 IST 2013,@andrewkealoha well shit Andrew. I figured it was about the same.
ManndaMichelle,Wed Aug 28 14:10:30 IST 2013,"@andrewkealoha mehhhhhhh..... Booze and/or sexual favors, your choice."
ManndaMichelle,Wed Aug 28 14:07:12 IST 2013,@andrewkealoha oh why thank you fan club😘
ManndaMichelle,Wed Aug 28 14:06:45 IST 2013,@33inchwood and direct numbers to hospitals and shit but who has time to find all those in an emergent situation
ManndaMichelle,Wed Aug 28 14:06:25 IST 2013,"@33inchwood there's probably laws against it though, hence only having 911"
ManndaMichelle,Wed Aug 28 13:47:10 IST 2013,But hey I'm not on the emergency response team so I guess I'm in no place to judge
ManndaMichelle,Wed Aug 28 13:46:46 IST 2013,"Obviously I wasn't there and don't have a clue what happened, but from what I saw it seemed a bit much.."
ManndaMichelle,Wed Aug 28 13:45:54 IST 2013,"So in total there was: two cop cars, at least 3 cops, an ambulance with 3 paramedics, and a fire truck with 5. All for one drunk guy?"
ManndaMichelle,Wed Aug 28 13:44:31 IST 2013,Slash young adults
ManndaMichelle,Wed Aug 28 13:44:21 IST 2013,Silly teenagers
ManndaMichelle,Wed Aug 28 13:44:16 IST 2013,Well apparently there had been cop cars here I couldn't see.... Pretty sure they took someone to the drunk tank #smh
ManndaMichelle,Wed Aug 28 13:39:32 IST 2013,"Just like oh I have an injury but it isn't life threatening and I'm alone, help me."
ManndaMichelle,Wed Aug 28 13:38:34 IST 2013,"There should be like a 9-1-2 instead if 9-1-1, like... I need help but not the flashing lights, two vehicles and 8 paramedics type of help."
ManndaMichelle,Wed Aug 28 13:30:39 IST 2013,"Lots of flashing lights, not a lot of hustle.... Sure hope it isn't a real emergency"
ManndaMichelle,Wed Aug 28 13:29:59 IST 2013,"@adrishilling but no, the ambulance is here now too"
ManndaMichelle,Wed Aug 28 13:29:34 IST 2013,@adrishilling OMG yes
ManndaMichelle,Wed Aug 28 13:29:03 IST 2013,Could you imagine driving a damn fire truck around Seattle?🚒😰 I had a hard enough time with my Honda pilot...
ManndaMichelle,Wed Aug 28 13:26:43 IST 2013,But alarms haven't gone off and they didn't look in a hurry so I mean that's good right?
ManndaMichelle,Wed Aug 28 13:26:00 IST 2013,"Well, there's a fire truck outside my window, I think they came into my building..."
ManndaMichelle,Wed Aug 28 12:43:30 IST 2013,"No specific significance, just something to think about I guess😊"
ManndaMichelle,Wed Aug 28 12:42:41 IST 2013,".....the things which are not seen are eternal"""
ManndaMichelle,Wed Aug 28 12:42:07 IST 2013,"""While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but...."
ManndaMichelle,Wed Aug 28 12:41:38 IST 2013,"I'm not dedicated to reading the bible, nor have I gone to church for a long time, but someone posted a verse a while back I really liked.."
ManndaMichelle,Wed Aug 28 11:12:29 IST 2013,"So if I ever need to hook my fire hose up I keep in my trunk, I can easily find a hydrant. ALWAYS PREPARED."
ManndaMichelle,Wed Aug 28 11:11:44 IST 2013,"Before it had been pointed out I never noticed the blue. I now see every single one,"
ManndaMichelle,Wed Aug 28 11:11:20 IST 2013,"Like freshman year, Mr. Ulrich said in WA state history the blue reflectors on the road indicate fire hydrants. And now I ALWAYS notice."
ManndaMichelle,Wed Aug 28 11:10:06 IST 2013,I hate things you can never forget or fail to notice once it's been pointed out
ManndaMichelle,Tue Aug 27 14:02:30 IST 2013,Waited till the middle of the night before I have people visit to actually put things on my walls... Oh well at least it's done now
ManndaMichelle,Tue Aug 27 13:23:53 IST 2013,"I don't take enough pictures in my life, time to change that📷✨"
ManndaMichelle,Tue Aug 27 13:18:57 IST 2013,"#firstworldproblems. At least I have a bed, thank you parents🙏"
ManndaMichelle,Tue Aug 27 13:18:18 IST 2013,"I mean putting that stupid fitted sheet on the mattress is not a gentle process, it's so awkward and cumbersome and difficult."
