newdarkcloud,Sun Feb 28 06:11:49 IST 2016,"We would not have a lot of game I hold it high regard with Ocarina of Time, so I must at least respect it for that."
newdarkcloud,Sun Feb 28 06:11:11 IST 2016,"That said, it's still extremely good. And it is to be applauded for pioneering a lot of concepts that 3D games (ie most games) use today."
newdarkcloud,Sun Feb 28 06:10:20 IST 2016,"While I did overall enjoy Ocarina of Time, I feel that it is quite overrated. I'd hardly call it the best game of all time."

newdarkcloud,Sun Feb 28 04:41:02 IST 2016,So that's Ocarina of Time complete. I think I'll just move straight into Majora's Mask next.
