Soldiers and cops: good
Criminals that are not them: bad as hell"
MurderBryan,Tue Mar 01 05:27:29 IST 2016,@djfilippone @dankmtl @GerardDiTrolio I have no regrets except for some of the nice things I've done
MurderBryan,Tue Mar 01 05:26:39 IST 2016,@dankmtl I like snarky and sarcastic pages because they are good memes to own people who have done you wrong but don't know yet
MurderBryan,Tue Mar 01 05:24:27 IST 2016,"@GerardDiTrolio @dankmtl Real Life Bad Guy, it's very good and will get you through the tough times after family court"

MurderBryan,Tue Mar 01 05:22:32 IST 2016,@dankmtl I'm getting some really good recommendations from the algorithm for sarcasm groups which I'm also a huge fan of
MurderBryan,Tue Mar 01 05:20:56 IST 2016,"Lmao, thank you @dankmtl for the Facebook group recommendation https://t.co/LrIQbPI1bP"

MurderBryan,Tue Mar 01 04:46:20 IST 2016,@twerkrobot I'm voting for him because I don't think he's a woman
MurderBryan,Tue Mar 01 04:45:05 IST 2016,"Idk pals, a lot of the people calling Donald Trump racist also called Bernie Sanders racist. Who should I believe?"

MurderBryan,Tue Mar 01 02:50:52 IST 2016,@GerardDiTrolio @fender_splendor @Brock_toon I don't think there will ever be a right time for that again
MurderBryan,Tue Mar 01 02:50:10 IST 2016,@GerardDiTrolio @fender_splendor @Brock_toon 100% agree but Dallas was their place.

MurderBryan,Tue Mar 01 02:44:41 IST 2016,@duyarvish @fender_splendor @epitasis I think it's time we have a McMahon in the government
MurderBryan,Tue Mar 01 02:33:36 IST 2016,@fender_splendor @epitasis I think voting for Hillary Clinton sends the message that we are a center-right country. Fuck that
MurderBryan,Tue Mar 01 02:29:38 IST 2016,"@fender_splendor @epitasis I did in 08 but not enthusiastically. More of a ""well my wife is voting so I might as well go too"""
MurderBryan,Tue Mar 01 02:26:48 IST 2016,@fender_splendor @epitasis I was like 10% gonna vote if Bernie won which is 9% more than any election in since 04
MurderBryan,Tue Mar 01 01:32:05 IST 2016,I'm not worried about the journalist. He's probably ok
MurderBryan,Mon Feb 29 22:11:23 IST 2016,@cushbomb @willmenaker @ByYourLogic I mean he would also be a conservative hero if he talked his way out of a DUI too
MurderBryan,Mon Feb 29 22:10:48 IST 2016,@cushbomb @willmenaker @ByYourLogic he's a conservative hero now
MurderBryan,Mon Feb 29 22:09:10 IST 2016,@willmenaker @ByYourLogic @cushbomb Did you guys see the guy that asked Bill Clinton about Benghazi and pissed him off?
MurderBryan,Mon Feb 29 21:44:19 IST 2016,@willmenaker @ByYourLogic @cushbomb The Benghazi endorsement is HUGE. Hillary got endorsed by the guys who shot the American flag.

MurderBryan,Mon Feb 29 06:40:01 IST 2016,@tholzerman any feud with Dolph Ziggler is bad imo
MurderBryan,Mon Feb 29 06:38:31 IST 2016,@tholzerman it really didn't get mentioned enough on the year end lists.
