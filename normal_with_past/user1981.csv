offersheet,Tue Mar 01 05:29:36 IST 2016,@DaveHeikkila @petbugs13 @khatinthekar exactly. team is screwed until there's a new owner. And even then no guarantee. Cld be more of same.
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 05:27:43 IST 2016,Canucks have 4 on active roster and 3 more in minors. Inexcusable from Benning. Not ONE trade for value. https://t.co/y8Eo3cApYA
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 05:25:29 IST 2016,@petbugs13 @khatinthekar then the team is doomed. Can NEVER recover. I'm not exaggerating.
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 05:24:14 IST 2016,"@petbugs13 @khatinthekar do you think Aq is THAT meddlesome? I don't doubt that he's getting in there. But THAT MUCH? If so, that's BAAAAAD."
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 05:23:10 IST 2016,@petbugs13 @khatinthekar ah. I see. But he'd have to be in on these calls then. Either that or JB would be reporting back directly to him.
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 05:20:45 IST 2016,@petbugs13 @khatinthekar seems extremely petty to me. Even for Aq and Gagliardi.
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 05:18:08 IST 2016,@khatinthekar They did. In Squamish. I'm not buying this story of Aq putting the kibosh on that deal. Nill called JB's bluff and JB lost.
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 04:55:35 IST 2016,@Verviticus hahah EXACTLY.

offersheet,Tue Mar 01 04:54:55 IST 2016,"@kmthehaggis I agree, and it just makes Benning look like he's 100% terrible at his job."
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 04:52:31 IST 2016,"And apparently that wasn't ""concrete"" like a 3rd rd pick. He's drowning now.  https://t.co/xQSBFf56FW"
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 04:51:22 IST 2016,@Verviticus not at all. Cuz his statements were contradictory left and right. And made him look like a blundering idiot.
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 04:50:11 IST 2016,"RT @ryanbiech: There were the following moved for pending UFA's:

1- 1st round pick

offersheet,Tue Mar 01 04:49:16 IST 2016,"But, didn't he say that the offer he got from DAL was comparable to the one made to CGY for Russell? https://t.co/mzHgPYvLtH"
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 04:42:15 IST 2016,Benning straight-up has no clue what's going on. He's digging his hole deeper and deeper. It's now a bottomless pit. https://t.co/TeX3LGT8DZ
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 04:35:25 IST 2016,Larsen isn't even under contract and currently plays in Russia. And that's what Benning is proud of. HOLY SHIT. https://t.co/fNAN6b5goa
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 04:30:52 IST 2016,@harry1619 @omarcanuck currently only 5 picks in the 2017 draft.

offersheet,Tue Mar 01 03:58:55 IST 2016,He has literally given away draft picks in deals this season. He's absurd. He just doesn't make any sense. https://t.co/2kI1mP26qT

offersheet,Tue Mar 01 03:50:26 IST 2016,@CarsonKopala that's what Hamhuis said in his press conf today.
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 03:46:27 IST 2016,@CarsonKopala . ok. but what i'm saying is that he outright said no to EC teams from the outset. Before there were even any offers.
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 03:43:16 IST 2016,@CarsonKopala i think we're talking about two different points here. s'ok - hard in 140 chars.
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 03:41:19 IST 2016,@CarsonKopala PIT and BOS were. But he stated today that he never okayed a move to an EC team. Moot point now anyway.
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 03:38:41 IST 2016,"@BeantownCanuck not only that, Kesler denied all along that he asked for a trade. Hamhuis? Has a PC and explains the whole process."
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 03:36:18 IST 2016,"@DaveHeikkila no. nor PIT either. Because I don't think either is that close to the top. But WSH, absolutely. If that became available."
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 03:27:34 IST 2016,"@BeantownCanuck I just don't think for 3-4 mos, it's THAT big of a deal. For the record, he did still open his NTC and #Canucks fucked up."

offersheet,Tue Mar 01 02:19:07 IST 2016,@SatiarShah And Benning and co should have put these wheels in motion WEEKS ago.

offersheet,Tue Mar 01 01:47:55 IST 2016,Later. Rinse. Repeat. Doomed to less than mediocrity. Destined to finish 20th ad infinitum.
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 01:47:05 IST 2016,"They'll overpay for terrible players like Sbisa and Dorsett, let more guys walk away for free on waiver claims, and never actually retool."

offersheet,Tue Mar 01 01:27:16 IST 2016,@chadgriz ppl are sick + tired of complete ineptitude + incompetence with this team. We had 2-3 good yrs of Gillis and then he cratered too.
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 01:19:16 IST 2016,@chadgriz thanks.
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 01:16:20 IST 2016,@chadgriz trading to a contender will always result in a late 1st. And that + Dano is a great return IMO.
