unktions,Tue Mar 01 05:29:26 IST 2016,i'm posting this more for myself as sorta verbal/written processing.
unktions,Tue Mar 01 05:28:35 IST 2016,"if you end up doing anything outside of the internet with that person then things change, but until then: internet friends are different."
unktions,Tue Mar 01 05:27:44 IST 2016,we don't have a responsibility to maintain the relationships we forge online--they're by nature sorta ephemeral.
unktions,Tue Mar 01 05:26:38 IST 2016,internet relationships are weird in how tenuous they are and how that's okay.
unktions,Tue Mar 01 05:24:32 IST 2016,"ah, another internet friendship lost in the ever-changing waves of ""what did i inadvertently say or do to make you ignore me, huh""."

unktions,Mon Feb 29 09:45:40 IST 2016,was looking for documentaries to watch on netflix and: there's a lot of really not interesting documentaries in the world.
unktions,Mon Feb 29 09:08:57 IST 2016,"eh, but that'd require the academy caring about anything. ha!"
unktions,Mon Feb 29 09:08:38 IST 2016,i wonder if leo's gonna win an academy award because the meme has brought a passive pressure to the academy..
unktions,Mon Feb 29 08:33:21 IST 2016,"one of my fave details about pokemon is that feraligatr's name omits the ""o"" b/c of the character limit. someone fought hard for that name."
unktions,Mon Feb 29 07:25:25 IST 2016,"it's sorta like the whole ""augmented senses for the blind"" thing. i'm seeing things i've never noticed, engaging in ways that are different."
unktions,Mon Feb 29 07:24:31 IST 2016,playing pokemon green has been satisfying in ways i didn't expect: being able to play without a language is an interesting gauge of quality.
unktions,Mon Feb 29 05:26:07 IST 2016,frustrated with the utter lack of good places to read in my town. starbux stinks and... that's p much it as far as cafe's go.

unktions,Mon Feb 29 01:41:15 IST 2016,"controversial opinion condensed: to progress as a medium, games need dedicated writers (that write well)."
unktions,Mon Feb 29 01:40:01 IST 2016,and for those arguing that the original japanese is always better: it's really not.
unktions,Mon Feb 29 01:38:48 IST 2016,"if you want to consider games art or whatever, i think developing better narrative is the first step towards a much better world."
unktions,Mon Feb 29 01:37:50 IST 2016,"breast augmentation, skinship, etc. isn't going to push the medium further, it's going to reinforce the ""games are for gross weirdos"" thing."
unktions,Mon Feb 29 01:36:32 IST 2016,i think @sethhahne said it best when he said that games are in their american 80's action flick phase.
unktions,Mon Feb 29 01:35:42 IST 2016,something i've been thinking about since the (bad) localization argument has been rising up: writing in (most) games just isn't that great.
