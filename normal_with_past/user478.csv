HabsNewsAndTalk,Tue Mar 01 02:11:21 IST 2016,"Food for thought but the top comment on Reddit about the DSP trade is a Devils fan saying: ""YESSSSS""

Sounds like us as well."
HabsNewsAndTalk,Tue Mar 01 02:06:25 IST 2016,"I'm not sure this was necessarily good for us, but it couldn't have been bad. Can't do much worse than DSP. I'll gladly take it. #Habs"
HabsNewsAndTalk,Tue Mar 01 02:02:47 IST 2016,BYE BYE DSP
HabsNewsAndTalk,Tue Mar 01 02:00:09 IST 2016,"On a scale of 1-10, 10 being absolutely necessary and 1 being absolutely pointless, the Mike Brown waiver claim was a 0. #Habs"
HabsNewsAndTalk,Tue Mar 01 01:46:59 IST 2016,LOL https://t.co/sOCGq8rTe0
HabsNewsAndTalk,Tue Mar 01 01:31:06 IST 2016,"Assuming there are no trades, I would say these last 12 months from Bergevin has been pretty unimpressive. Not too happy with his decisions."
HabsNewsAndTalk,Tue Mar 01 01:02:47 IST 2016,What's the point of calling up McCarron if you're going to put him with those line-mates? Give him a real chance.  https://t.co/2a2Dfdvn2P
HabsNewsAndTalk,Tue Mar 01 00:37:00 IST 2016,@paciorettys Hopefully. I don't know how adamant he is on not waiving his NMC though. Tough to speculate
HabsNewsAndTalk,Tue Mar 01 00:36:01 IST 2016,Just want to add that I still can't believe we gave Emelin a NMC. How the hell did this contract happen...
HabsNewsAndTalk,Tue Mar 01 00:35:12 IST 2016,"I know he has a NMC, but he could waive it. I also haven't heard his name out there once, which doesn't mean everything but still"
HabsNewsAndTalk,Tue Mar 01 00:32:38 IST 2016,"If Russell gets that return, don't even tell me that we can't move Emelin if we wanted to. What are we waiting for? #Habs"
HabsNewsAndTalk,Tue Mar 01 00:23:10 IST 2016,@Monctonscout Lol
HabsNewsAndTalk,Tue Mar 01 00:21:29 IST 2016,@Monctonscout He's clearly still a capable NHL forward though. We totally fucked up with him.
HabsNewsAndTalk,Tue Mar 01 00:20:48 IST 2016,Move DD/Emelin/DSP in the next hour.
HabsNewsAndTalk,Tue Mar 01 00:15:44 IST 2016,Whatever TOR gets for Parenteau will definitely piss me off. Another asset that could've been ours had he been managed properly.
HabsNewsAndTalk,Mon Feb 29 23:51:57 IST 2016,Apparently I was wrong
HabsNewsAndTalk,Mon Feb 29 23:28:27 IST 2016,I'm about to get on the metro which means everyone is about to start making trades so I can miss it all. Enjoy
HabsNewsAndTalk,Mon Feb 29 23:03:23 IST 2016,@Monctonscout what
HabsNewsAndTalk,Mon Feb 29 23:01:12 IST 2016,@Monctonscout It would make sense based on Therrien's past decisions.
HabsNewsAndTalk,Mon Feb 29 22:55:43 IST 2016,"Mike Brown will get more ice than Galchenyuk, won't he? #Habs"
HabsNewsAndTalk,Mon Feb 29 22:42:24 IST 2016,So dumb. https://t.co/rBc86Ve6fg
HabsNewsAndTalk,Mon Feb 29 22:36:24 IST 2016,Why....
HabsNewsAndTalk,Mon Feb 29 22:27:46 IST 2016,@LeoJL8 lol
HabsNewsAndTalk,Mon Feb 29 22:25:45 IST 2016,@LeoJL8 ?
HabsNewsAndTalk,Mon Feb 29 21:08:11 IST 2016,I love you again Bergevin https://t.co/iIVJ1KlV54
HabsNewsAndTalk,Mon Feb 29 20:32:30 IST 2016,@NYCHabs good deal!
HabsNewsAndTalk,Mon Feb 29 20:29:19 IST 2016,For the people who think the #Habs need a first line center... Have you ever heard of a person named Alex Galchenyuk? Heard he's good.
HabsNewsAndTalk,Mon Feb 29 20:23:56 IST 2016,@HabsChronicle @HockeyyInsiderr anything but fake trades!
HabsNewsAndTalk,Mon Feb 29 20:21:46 IST 2016,@HabsChronicle @HockeyyInsiderr tread lightly with sarcasm on deadline day. Something I've learnt over the years :)
HabsNewsAndTalk,Mon Feb 29 20:17:11 IST 2016,When you're blessed with an online class on trade deadline day so you can refresh Twitter for 2 hours >
HabsNewsAndTalk,Mon Feb 29 18:33:30 IST 2016,I envy everyone who can watch deadline day on TSN today. Enjoy it!
HabsNewsAndTalk,Mon Feb 29 18:22:01 IST 2016,@KRIKT couldn't say
HabsNewsAndTalk,Mon Feb 29 18:21:08 IST 2016,@WSpy Winnik
HabsNewsAndTalk,Mon Feb 29 10:10:40 IST 2016,That's why I said I felt we could've gotten more than we did for Weise. I wasn't upset but the value for that kind of guy seems to be higher
HabsNewsAndTalk,Mon Feb 29 05:20:39 IST 2016,@BWildeCTV oh yeah? Meet @PatrickTallon81
HabsNewsAndTalk,Mon Feb 29 05:04:04 IST 2016,@NYRainjerz enjoy it now haha take advantage of the window you got
HabsNewsAndTalk,Mon Feb 29 05:02:19 IST 2016,"@NYRainjerz yeah true. I think it's smart to go all in, but it has its consequences"
HabsNewsAndTalk,Mon Feb 29 04:59:59 IST 2016,"@NYRainjerz @SMahoney_13 Ok, that's fine. It's a good strategy. Doesn't change the fact that your future won't be good. Both things are true"
HabsNewsAndTalk,Mon Feb 29 04:58:31 IST 2016,@NYRainjerz @SMahoney_13 @DiehardNYRFan your comment sounds like you're laughing at people who claim you don't have a future
HabsNewsAndTalk,Mon Feb 29 04:56:56 IST 2016,"@NYRainjerz @SMahoney_13 @DiehardNYRFan I agree with you. But your point was that you guys are still set in the future, which you won't be."
HabsNewsAndTalk,Mon Feb 29 04:54:56 IST 2016,"@NYRainjerz @SMahoney_13 @DiehardNYRFan I'm not saying it's a bad strategy, but we're talking about prospects/picks which you will lack"
HabsNewsAndTalk,Mon Feb 29 04:52:29 IST 2016,"@SMahoney_13 @DiehardNYRFan @NYRainjerz it's not that they bad prospects, it's that aren't getting any new ones while everyone else will."
HabsNewsAndTalk,Mon Feb 29 04:29:35 IST 2016,"If we're going to trade for Yakupov/Eberle/Drouin now would be the best time... We have time for development. Oh wait, MT. Nevermind."
HabsNewsAndTalk,Sun Feb 28 09:55:34 IST 2016,CURRY OH NO
HabsNewsAndTalk,Sun Feb 28 08:26:05 IST 2016,#Habs sweep the Leafs in the regular season. At least we did something right this year!
HabsNewsAndTalk,Sun Feb 28 08:02:59 IST 2016,Oh captain <3
HabsNewsAndTalk,Sun Feb 28 07:57:08 IST 2016,#HABS SPANKING SOME LEAF ASS
HabsNewsAndTalk,Sun Feb 28 07:32:42 IST 2016,Byron has the exact same amount of ice-time as Pacioretty. Ok then.
HabsNewsAndTalk,Sun Feb 28 07:31:07 IST 2016,@LWOSalexkou above average with ability to fill in top 6
HabsNewsAndTalk,Sun Feb 28 07:28:39 IST 2016,@Monctonscout DLR isn't nearly as good as Eller at the moment. There's no way in hell you think that. I don't believe you.
