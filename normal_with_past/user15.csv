Misundastudent,Fri Mar 25 16:21:35 IST 2016,@BadKariri no worries. I'd be upset too. I tweeted at a bunch of people who I know saw it last night as well so the TL is a lil dangerous
Misundastudent,Fri Mar 25 16:17:33 IST 2016,@BadKariri don't worry I don't believe in spoiling any sort of media for people. Don't read my tweets if you want fresh eyes for it though
Misundastudent,Fri Mar 25 16:15:50 IST 2016,"@BadKariri it's not a spoiler, was only referring to general nature of Superman, that despite his intrinsic goodness humanity is ungrateful"

Misundastudent,Fri Mar 25 15:29:59 IST 2016,"Cus you see, if that were me with the powers of a daughter of Krypton, humanity will catch many an L in my wake. Do I look like your mate?"
Misundastudent,Fri Mar 25 15:28:17 IST 2016,That Superman does become a villain at the 1st sign of humanity's ungratefulness is clearly a testament to the good upbringing of Clark Kent
Misundastudent,Fri Mar 25 15:26:08 IST 2016,"@yoitsBeazy to his credit, Superman does everything poss to minimise destruction cus he actually cares. That's more than most human villains"

Misundastudent,Fri Mar 25 15:09:18 IST 2016,"@CamposSquareRo nah, all you have to do is get the 1st set of triplets to come and teach the 2nd set what they learnt in school that day."
Misundastudent,Fri Mar 25 15:02:02 IST 2016,@Kila_Kam LIKE! Even though he's the heir apparent why would LexCorp allow such a mentally unhinged & uncharismatuc person run the company?
Misundastudent,Fri Mar 25 14:58:45 IST 2016,@topriddy I haven't gotten into the specifics of any major groundbreaking plotpoints of the movie. Just talking about the creative direction
Misundastudent,Fri Mar 25 14:37:02 IST 2016,"@yoitsBeazy to me share, the parts that were good were pretty great. But the parts that were bad seemed to drag on https://t.co/YPs6MD1VDw"
Misundastudent,Fri Mar 25 14:34:55 IST 2016,"There were about 5 times in BVS when I just kept thinking ""hmm maybe if these 2 people just had a convo, it would solve all their problems"""
Misundastudent,Fri Mar 25 14:31:26 IST 2016,I did not quite find Lex Luthor all that menacing or calculating. To me seemed to have just kinda decided to try to be the villain on a whim
Misundastudent,Fri Mar 25 14:29:59 IST 2016,"I know alot of people quite liked Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor is a superb actor, I just hated the lines (+ the amount of it) they gave him"
Misundastudent,Fri Mar 25 14:27:23 IST 2016,"But I have to say this, there was far too much unnecessary dialogue and seemingly inconsistent holes for me to really get into the groove"
Misundastudent,Fri Mar 25 14:25:17 IST 2016,"For what it's worth, I gave BVS my full attention. I caught all the Messiah comparisons. I caught some of the cool lighting effects they did"
Misundastudent,Fri Mar 25 14:21:34 IST 2016,@OtherBukowski ðŸ˜‚. Did DC think Kenya would actually sue them or something? I am not sure that their GDP is up to DC's net worth

Misundastudent,Fri Mar 25 06:18:15 IST 2016,Amy Adams as Lois Lane has gotta be the only modern damsel in distress to get kidnapped by the bad guy in the same outfit twice
Misundastudent,Fri Mar 25 06:15:54 IST 2016,"@OtherBukowski @ImNotAHooligans Batman gave up on 2+ years of training, hard work & resentment over a fucking coincidence of name. Juslaidat"
Misundastudent,Fri Mar 25 06:09:53 IST 2016,"@Osi_Suave @OtherBukowski probably cus it was, scratched up too. At that point, he's just a guy with means but no tested  hero experience"
Misundastudent,Fri Mar 25 06:05:42 IST 2016,"Tomorrow we can talk about the whole ""Nairomi, Africa"" thing"
Misundastudent,Fri Mar 25 06:04:02 IST 2016,@OtherBukowski @Osi_Suave think his fighting was pretty believable. He wasn't meant to look like he was used to fighting superheroes/aliens
Misundastudent,Fri Mar 25 05:46:58 IST 2016,"RT @Omarvelli: I'm very sure even the director of X-men doesn't know if this new one is set in the present, past or future. Smh"

Misundastudent,Fri Mar 25 05:44:54 IST 2016,Zach Snyder tomorrow after reading fan reviews https://t.co/ysSLJ4b1kz
Misundastudent,Fri Mar 25 05:33:34 IST 2016,What I think Zach Snyder didn't realise is that the majority just wanted a 2 hour fight of Batman and Superman. No need for plot
Misundastudent,Fri Mar 25 05:28:46 IST 2016,Can't be playing with ur life anyhow when u're oga kpatapata. Ur shareholders don't care that it's superhero battle that tanked their stocks
Misundastudent,Fri Mar 25 05:24:48 IST 2016,Batfleck was not playing with his life anyhow in BVS. The guy dey go office and prolly has AGM & stuffs to prepare for. I appreciate that
Misundastudent,Fri Mar 25 05:19:58 IST 2016,"Sigh, after I wore my WW pata for good luck"
Misundastudent,Fri Mar 25 05:12:40 IST 2016,@_Kaelo_ the prob is that when it was good it was pretty great but there was just an unnecessary excessive amount of drama and dialogue
Misundastudent,Fri Mar 25 05:07:40 IST 2016,@OtherBukowski I appreciated the amount of shade and pettiness that Jeremy Irons brought to the role of Alfred. He wasn't a toxic enabler
Misundastudent,Fri Mar 25 05:01:22 IST 2016,"I don't wanna spoil Batman Vs Superman with any reviews. That being said, I am judging anyone I see with contrary views"
