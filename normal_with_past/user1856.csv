LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 05:29:38 IST 2016,"@ShiraGlassman @stavvers did someone say vampire? I need more queer vampires to read, while I write a bunch."
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 05:27:47 IST 2016,@rAdelaidegrl I do like shopping. Like a lot. Online shopping is so fun. No people and they bring it to my house! Introvert paradise.
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 05:25:45 IST 2016,@rAdelaidegrl endorphins would be fun. I kind of get a buzz from writing a lot...sad writer is sad.
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 05:24:42 IST 2016,@rAdelaidegrl those are good reasons. Only reason I try not to over eat is clothes. I've been bigger. And I didn't like it.
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 05:23:22 IST 2016,@LeighWilder42 damn pot laws. I'd so try it for pain. Probably better for me than my pain meds
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 05:21:13 IST 2016,@TorquereKristi @j_talbot_84 you love pits right? How cute is this baby! https://t.co/cY2SH60V0X
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 05:19:03 IST 2016,"@rAdelaidegrl I think you do really well. I know you've had a break, but you work hard, and I think you do great!"
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 05:17:23 IST 2016,"@accrues the comedian I like is Irish, and he said he melted lol its very cold and wet there."
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 05:16:28 IST 2016,@LeighWilder42 cool. I hear it's pretty
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 05:16:04 IST 2016,"@GummyFredo ditto. I'm a ray of sunshine to others in my advice. Glass full, but my glass is full of vodka"
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 05:13:22 IST 2016,@rAdelaidegrl you're awesome. I don't think I'd have the will power to go to the gym so often even if I was healthier.
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 05:10:53 IST 2016,@Zoodlemouse13 well they are a plant?
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 05:09:02 IST 2016,Can you show butt on facebook? Not my butt by the way!
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 05:08:09 IST 2016,@accrues I think both are a big deal here because of the long travel to get their. It's so funny hearing them talk about the heat!
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 05:06:25 IST 2016,"@accrues exactly what I need. I know what I want to write. I'm excited by it, but focusing through the pain and wonky brain is hard!"
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 05:05:12 IST 2016,@accrues that sounds amazing. I've heard comics here talk about going to it. But I can see it taking all the spoons. I will share mine
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 05:03:44 IST 2016,@ShiraGlassman @coliver_writes sounds very useful. I will check it out more. I like order. Luckily not OCD levels. But order pleases me.
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 05:02:10 IST 2016,@accrues tomorrow is a slow day I think. Hoping to write a ton if I feel better. Need more focus!
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 05:00:41 IST 2016,@accrues sounds like a busy day! Don't over do it!
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 05:00:07 IST 2016,@accrues yay for friends visiting! I hope you have a great time!
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 04:59:10 IST 2016,@ShiraGlassman @coliver_writes I always review if I can. And a good list system would be great
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 04:58:37 IST 2016,@ShiraGlassman @coliver_writes I've been emailed reviews from GR. I try to use them to see what things people are responding too.
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 04:56:53 IST 2016,"@accrues very sore. And funny mood. But could be worse. Wrote a little, which makes me happy. Got plans for today?"
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 04:54:47 IST 2016,@coliver_writes @ShiraGlassman I'm very interested. I love magical stories!
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 04:52:35 IST 2016,@ShiraGlassman @coliver_writes I need to use GR more. Haven't since I set it up! But I will. Need to spread the word about great stories!
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 04:50:26 IST 2016,@ShiraGlassman @coliver_writes lawyer for the dead? *grabby hands*
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 04:48:25 IST 2016,"@rickygervais I find you very funny, but I will admit I love your cat more than you. I'm sorry."
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 04:47:04 IST 2016,@LeighWilder42 if you go somewhere cool I want pics. I love seeing places.
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 04:42:32 IST 2016,@XXXTyRoderick people think they own you because they've seen you naked. But you don't own people your soul or private life.
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 04:41:03 IST 2016,@accrues morning/night! How are you feeling bb?
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 04:36:05 IST 2016,"@RomeoLacoste wow how did you get the white to stay so bright. My tattoos aren't bad, but this is epic."
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 04:34:21 IST 2016,@accrues both are total hotties. So that makes sense.
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 03:26:00 IST 2016,"Wrote for an hour, it didn't flow, but some words are better than none I guess."
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 03:23:39 IST 2016,@XXXTyRoderick hope things aren't too bad sweetheart. You deserve a good Monday and a good week.
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 03:20:58 IST 2016,I think the cervix man I told you about could use some lessons....maybe not through song.  https://t.co/Ksce8R0BEJ
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 03:14:04 IST 2016,@ShiraGlassman had no plans to tag them as anything other than m/m because I'm writing trans MEN no matter what is in their pants.
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 03:12:56 IST 2016,"@ShiraGlassman read the thread, and I didn't think an m/m writer would be so narrow minded. I have stories coming with trans characters, I -"
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 01:56:04 IST 2016,Writing time. Trying to distract myself from pain and feeling crappy with sexy men finding love.
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 00:54:23 IST 2016,"Going to ask all the men on my TL to marry me, so I can start a glove collection  https://t.co/fngKUy2XDL"
LjHamlin,Tue Mar 01 00:07:48 IST 2016,"Been a while since I had to use my knee support, don't think I could walk without it right now. So much pain today."
LjHamlin,Mon Feb 29 20:40:09 IST 2016,@i_amthecosmos I laughed so hard.
LjHamlin,Sun Feb 28 08:31:43 IST 2016,@BL805SV https://t.co/wvHOkGdZZL
LjHamlin,Sun Feb 28 08:30:29 IST 2016,@Zoodlemouse13 @rAdelaidegrl I found it funny. The way they thought it would make their kids sick or whatever *rolls eyes*
LjHamlin,Sun Feb 28 08:29:12 IST 2016,"@BL805SV good to know I'm in company that doesn't mind. Sometimes I talk about my books and shock people. Have a good night, I'm off."
LjHamlin,Sun Feb 28 08:27:23 IST 2016,I should go to sleep. Night twitter https://t.co/8edVQY6ODj
LjHamlin,Sun Feb 28 08:24:41 IST 2016,@BL805SV I'm so used to everything having a naughty edge. Writing erotica has changed my brain lol
LjHamlin,Sun Feb 28 08:22:21 IST 2016,@BL805SV I feel bad that my brain went to a dirty place. I'm so glad you found it.
LjHamlin,Sun Feb 28 08:16:15 IST 2016,@BL805SV unless you did. And I'm thinking bullet sex toy......
LjHamlin,Sun Feb 28 08:14:43 IST 2016,@BL805SV took me like five seconds longer than it should to realize you didn't mean you'd been shooting guns lol
LjHamlin,Sun Feb 28 08:13:04 IST 2016,@accrues @rAdelaidegrl Ha that's what people get for eating salad!
