lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 05:29:26 IST 2016,"@narumemeyamei yes, yes I do.

My fantasy alter ego is delightfully lowkey awful and I'm so pleased, this is totally my character type."
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 05:27:54 IST 2016,"@narumemeyamei Jihye is my beautiful but terrifying bird daughter, she should totally be on my side of the fantasy war. So I get AJ too."
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 05:20:13 IST 2016,"@narumemeyamei idk if you really talk to Mels but you gotta put my other dog in, who am I in any AU without my loyal henchdog??"
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 04:47:40 IST 2016,#lovelt I currently have 43 R cards just chilling in my present box. This isn't counting teachers or alpacas. I love being a shitty hoarder.
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 04:45:18 IST 2016,"#lovelt >gets a """"new personal high score"""" on yuuji no-change
>last place

Thank you for reminding me my pure team is The Worst."
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 04:41:29 IST 2016,#lovelt Begrudgingly goes back to playing on ex because my inability to maintain my combo on technical is beginning to make me feel bad. :')
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 04:38:07 IST 2016,"@psiten pretty sure it's not, because I've done it too many times and some of them at least are really niche and therefore unlikely."
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 04:34:16 IST 2016,"Jihye faved my ""what if I drown myself"" tweet so fast it was kind of alarming."
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 04:33:26 IST 2016,"Me, 1/12 of the way into my self-appointed task: this is hard what if I go take a shower because then there's the possibility I might drown."
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 04:31:37 IST 2016,"At least one of my fics is posted now, Just... Gotta... Do the other two......"
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 04:31:23 IST 2016,"I still love the katamiyu tag, which is literally just me and my friends, one of whom vanished into the ether."
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 04:26:57 IST 2016,"And before anyone gives me pointers: it's not paragraphing or HTML it's the hell of summarizing, titling, and tagging my shit. Kill me."
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 04:26:13 IST 2016,"So far I have formatted: one.

We'll see how this goes."
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 04:26:02 IST 2016,Anyway I'm using my intense and powerful procrastination energy to try and get myself to format a dozen fics for AO3.
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 04:25:43 IST 2016,"I hate that if a tag isn't canonical, AO3 takes out my capitalization so it stands out from all my other canonical tags!!"
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 04:13:13 IST 2016,"@narumemeyamei @refreshing_kun please do, I wanna know who my generals are, I'm very excited to get to be a villain in your friend AU. 0u0"
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 04:10:58 IST 2016,@narumemeyamei @refreshing_kun am I the crown prince. does this mean Wes is my half-brother. Wes we're related!
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 04:07:41 IST 2016,"@narumemeyamei @refreshing_kun Okay so, what I'm gathering here is, I have generals of doom. Tell me more."
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 03:33:56 IST 2016,@blue_mels Mels god dammit
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 03:14:32 IST 2016,@grandpa_ebooks yeah that's really not the ideal. How am I supposed to motivate you if not with rewards??
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 03:13:05 IST 2016,@grandpa_ebooks this is eternally disappointing to me
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 03:06:48 IST 2016,@grandpa_ebooks how do you respond to bribery
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 03:02:19 IST 2016,"@grandpa_ebooks feed it to me directly, I want it"
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 03:02:11 IST 2016,"@sportssin I can do 3k in an hour but I'm pretty sure I still won't manage 1k in 20 minutes, somehow it doesn't work that way."
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 03:01:43 IST 2016,@grandpa_ebooks BANGS FISTS ON DESK ABOUT FRIDAY
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:58:56 IST 2016,@grandpa_ebooks I don't have time to write any of these things but I planned a fic for each day this week because I like taunting myself
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:58:13 IST 2016,"@grandpa_ebooks oh, I wanted to tell you I wanna write rarepair week things in space and I realize my ideal shiramiyu is, almost this,,"
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:56:54 IST 2016,@grandpa_ebooks there would be a lot of screaming this is a terrible idea
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:56:14 IST 2016,"@sportssin gently clutches face, I love this cat

waves vaguely at my to-do list, is it a warmup if it's gonna be at least 1k words?"
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:55:17 IST 2016,"@grandpa_ebooks I don't think you've seen me do it ever so I guess it's more, you want to see me do it a first time, while screaming"
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:53:34 IST 2016,"Follows up Rinbu Revolution with Cruel Angel's Thesis, this is totally a fine and wise choice in soundtrack which won't make me Slowly Die."
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:52:33 IST 2016,"@sportssin SIGHS LOUDLY, you are a very good cat and I am about to, probably, make an irresponsible decision."
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:51:45 IST 2016,@sportssin I find this incredibly menacing
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:50:43 IST 2016,"@grandpa_ebooks IT'S BEEN A REALLY LONG TIME

but also writing characters as short-fuse as this is hard for me, maybe, it's better,,"
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:49:22 IST 2016,"@grandpa_ebooks nice

let's be honest I am Very In Favor of this as well but none of my fandoms for A While have catered to that dynamic."
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:47:12 IST 2016,@grandpa_ebooks although I guess maybe half your ship doesn't want to be punched? who knows. mine are not at a punching level.
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:46:23 IST 2016,"@grandpa_ebooks that's kinder, the punching pretty much is the kissing

I pick one-directional hate so I get a conflict in priorities."
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:44:55 IST 2016,"I pick ships that can be lowkey hateships on purpose, and then I get sad I do this to myself over and over."
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:44:27 IST 2016,"""I just want to write these two characters kissing, but I set up a premise where one of them doesn't even LIKE the other in this scene."""
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:41:35 IST 2016,"@grandpa_ebooks I'm listening to it, this was a fine decision. It's... Fine..."
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:36:12 IST 2016,It is five pm and I guess I ought to do some writing.
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:35:33 IST 2016,@grandpa_ebooks it worked out for me but now I have to go actually play it
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:32:55 IST 2016,@grandpa_ebooks okay but your caption makes me wanna listen to the song and I regret this impulse
lirahaiku,Mon Mar 21 23:14:49 IST 2016,"@SHlNKAIHAYATO oh, dang, weird. But eyyyy at least you can plan for en. I'm a hoarder so I'll def have 50 gems by then."
lirahaiku,Mon Mar 21 23:01:51 IST 2016,@SHlNKAIHAYATO time to buy a jp gift card I guess!!
lirahaiku,Mon Mar 21 22:15:54 IST 2016,"@theburdisin even if I saved for a whole year though, like, how many gems would I have. 3 shots at Umi, 3 shots Maki, I'm probably broke."
lirahaiku,Mon Mar 21 22:13:17 IST 2016,"@theburdisin or is it that there will literally never be a next shot, because. screams."
lirahaiku,Mon Mar 21 22:12:56 IST 2016,"@theburdisin time to do three at a time and then sit on my love gems till the next shot, then!! I'm probably... Too serious...."
lirahaiku,Mon Mar 21 22:10:49 IST 2016,"#lovelt I think I'm joking but also, like, my cool and smile teams can't really GET any better than they are. I just need more URs."
