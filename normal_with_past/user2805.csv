AshleyChal,Fri Feb 26 03:58:17 IST 2016,Good news: Daphne's knee stayed 100% in place 100% of the time last night. Bad news: now she has a stress rash on her neck (and on my heart)

AshleyChal,Tue Feb 23 06:31:37 IST 2016,@haleymartian @Wright_Breauna my little Daphne is the most concerned Santa chihuahua out there.
AshleyChal,Tue Feb 23 06:19:40 IST 2016,"@haleymartian @Wright_Breauna sweetest hashtag I've ever seen, but instead just send some positive vibes to her stupid knee joints!"
AshleyChal,Tue Feb 23 06:18:10 IST 2016,@haleymartian @Wright_Breauna you guys will do no such thing!! This is why savings accounts and payment plans exist!
AshleyChal,Tue Feb 23 05:55:53 IST 2016,"Aaaaand it's dislocated again! 3 times in 36 hours. Poor dog, her whimpers are breaking my heart! Surgery is like $1,000+ though."
AshleyChal,Tue Feb 23 04:10:45 IST 2016,"So turns out my dog dislocated her knee and it's basically a forever injury. COOL JOB, DOG."
AshleyChal,Mon Feb 22 07:44:15 IST 2016,Daphne hurt her leg very badly. She refuses to leave the kitchen and will not let us pick her up. It's so sad. https://t.co/K3EpaQVAoO

AshleyChal,Fri Feb 19 07:24:04 IST 2016,So he finally caves and takes it somewhere. There's some leak and the spark plugs & some pipe are busted. Basically I'm always right. 💁🏻
AshleyChal,Fri Feb 19 07:22:13 IST 2016,I've been driving Josh's car this week bc he said my car was fine but I wasn't allowed to drive it. Meaning it wasn't fine.
AshleyChal,Fri Feb 19 05:45:40 IST 2016,New blood sugar meds are actually working! It feels great to feel in control instead of guilty and confused for the first time in a month!
