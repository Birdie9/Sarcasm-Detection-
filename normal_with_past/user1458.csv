TheJoeMarino,Tue Mar 01 02:59:50 IST 2016,@DavidBullin good year for defense as a whole. Some decent offensive line. Lacking at offensive skill positions despite a few guys.
TheJoeMarino,Tue Mar 01 02:33:56 IST 2016,@The_Matt_Ford Emmanuel Ogbah and Charles Tapper are sending me back to the tape. Didn't expect what I saw.
TheJoeMarino,Tue Mar 01 02:30:48 IST 2016,"""Relieving"" part of Combine being over is that there is minimal new info on these prospects. Can focus on stacking & finalizing my board."

TheJoeMarino,Tue Mar 01 01:24:36 IST 2016,You can tune in at 4pm ET to catch my spot.  https://t.co/0JK5VSJj1h
TheJoeMarino,Tue Mar 01 01:05:00 IST 2016,@MikeSedjro I don't think he would be my highest rated player on the Board at number 6. Not far off though.
TheJoeMarino,Tue Mar 01 01:04:15 IST 2016,@chrisdawg83 Need to check but I do not think so.

TheJoeMarino,Tue Mar 01 00:52:47 IST 2016,@Russell_Brown51 Interesting. Surprised if Buck fell to 11. LIke seeing Lynch not R1. Clark at 31 would be gross lol. Tread to TB=surprise
TheJoeMarino,Tue Mar 01 00:47:44 IST 2016,"Florida CB Vernon Hargreaves had a 39"" vertical jump."

TheJoeMarino,Tue Mar 01 00:17:24 IST 2016,"Rich Eisen, Michigan 2016 40-yard dash is an official 5.94. Personal best. Getting faster as he ages. 

#RunRichRun"
TheJoeMarino,Tue Mar 01 00:01:12 IST 2016,"@DakMoyer those should all be done, just awaiting results."
TheJoeMarino,Mon Feb 29 23:54:22 IST 2016,@nfldraftupdate Hargreaves is 30 pounds heavier. Really opposite in terms of frame.
TheJoeMarino,Mon Feb 29 23:37:43 IST 2016,"@Jaberuski Nats 3rd starter, Gio Gonzalez would be a long reliever for Mets. Mets take the east IMO. Rotation is superior. Hitting is close."
TheJoeMarino,Mon Feb 29 22:31:38 IST 2016,"Florida State DB Jalen Ramsey first unofficial 40/10:  4.46/1.58

Already leaped 41.5"" in the vertical  & 11'3'' in the broad jump."
TheJoeMarino,Mon Feb 29 22:26:05 IST 2016,Any word on why Duke S Jeremy Cash did not participate earlier?
TheJoeMarino,Mon Feb 29 22:24:34 IST 2016,Florida CB Vernon Hargreaves leaped 10'10'' in the broad jump. Excellent measurement.
TheJoeMarino,Mon Feb 29 22:23:10 IST 2016,"Southern Utah Miles Killebrew first unofficial 40/10:  4.67/1.66

Lines up with what I saw on tape which is poor play speed."

TheJoeMarino,Mon Feb 29 21:49:05 IST 2016,@BestHumanTalent Lotta guys who just don't understand the game.
TheJoeMarino,Mon Feb 29 21:46:53 IST 2016,11'3'' Broad jump. My goodness.  https://t.co/fTt1hEeurH
TheJoeMarino,Mon Feb 29 21:46:26 IST 2016,@BestHumanTalent No doubt about it. I've really limited the voices I listen to over the last few years.

TheJoeMarino,Mon Feb 29 21:23:49 IST 2016,@Anthony_Becht That and he has the best ball skills in this group. Natural playmaker and cover man.
TheJoeMarino,Mon Feb 29 21:18:21 IST 2016,"It's clear that Florida CB Vernon Hargreaves has shown the best ball skills in drills. Naturally tracks, adjusts & securely catches the ball"
TheJoeMarino,Mon Feb 29 21:13:32 IST 2016,Absolutely love the way that William & Mary S DeAndre Houston-Carson is competing out here. Giving max effort & finishing drills. Good work.
TheJoeMarino,Mon Feb 29 21:00:25 IST 2016,@Alexander1Great 4.50 for VH3. That simulcast had him a hair behind Patrick Peterson.
TheJoeMarino,Mon Feb 29 20:43:25 IST 2016,Collectively this group is underwhelming in this drill. Clunky feet and tight hips everywhere.
TheJoeMarino,Mon Feb 29 20:31:35 IST 2016,@Trombley22 I would guess 4.38-4.42

TheJoeMarino,Mon Feb 29 20:26:35 IST 2016,@Trombley22 just inconsistent. I trust the 2nd round of times as they are coming from Casserly's hand time.
TheJoeMarino,Mon Feb 29 20:20:34 IST 2016,These times are out of control. Wait for the official times.
TheJoeMarino,Mon Feb 29 20:04:31 IST 2016,@JeffRisdon I prefer to focus on the 35 games prior to that
