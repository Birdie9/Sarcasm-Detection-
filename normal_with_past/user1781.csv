Johnathan_Wood1,Tue Mar 01 05:29:39 IST 2016,2012 WAS went 6 to 2 for 2 1sts and a 2nd. CLE went 4 to 3 for a 4th. TB 7 to 5 for 4th. DAL 14 to 6 for 2nd.
Johnathan_Wood1,Tue Mar 01 05:27:13 IST 2016,BUF going 9 to 4 in 2014 took an extra 1st and 4th. CLE 9 to 8 in 14 took a 5th. 2013 MIA went 12 to 3 for a 2nd; STL 16 to 7 for 2nd + 7th
Johnathan_Wood1,Tue Mar 01 05:22:57 IST 2016,"@martinez3507 @ArthurArkush if you mean RG3, going from 6 to 3 is much more expensive than 11 to 8. But yeah."
Johnathan_Wood1,Tue Mar 01 05:08:25 IST 2016,@ChiBearsAD like Jets were rumored to be doing with Wilkerson a few weeks ago
Johnathan_Wood1,Tue Mar 01 05:06:14 IST 2016,Trading up in the top 10 of the draft typically requires at least a 1st and 2nd. Easy no thank you there. https://t.co/XEEehIoH94
Johnathan_Wood1,Tue Mar 01 04:27:15 IST 2016,@Chiguy8506 quality DL pass rushers rarely hit the open market.  And they're very expensive when they do.
Johnathan_Wood1,Tue Mar 01 04:22:52 IST 2016,RT @JamesFox917: Biggs also doesn't believe that the #Bears will get a draft pick for TE Martellus Bennett but they are in fact moving on f‚Ä¶
Johnathan_Wood1,Tue Mar 01 04:18:26 IST 2016,"Meaning Malik Jackson will be best DL, and maybe best player overall, to hit FA, so he likely gets way too much $$ https://t.co/b3QKA7XQCY"
Johnathan_Wood1,Tue Mar 01 02:30:23 IST 2016,"@brennenmcmann if I could get Newton, Luck, Wilson? Done deal. Top QB under 30, you're set for a decade."
Johnathan_Wood1,Tue Mar 01 02:26:41 IST 2016,@brennenmcmann I can think of a number of QBs I'd do that for. But they never get that designation for that very reason.
Johnathan_Wood1,Tue Mar 01 02:21:59 IST 2016,@brennenmcmann nobody is giving up 2 1sts + a big contract to sign Jeffery

Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 08:07:19 IST 2016,"@black_42 gonna set the market for OG.  Perfect storm for that, plus he might get paid more like OT because he can do that."
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 08:05:49 IST 2016,"@black_42 Osemele is the best OL hitting FA this year.  $10M/year, minimum.  FA contracts are gonna be insane."
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 07:29:54 IST 2016,@Ditka2ATX @HalasBearReport Fuller got better as last year went in. Solid CB.
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 07:29:02 IST 2016,RT @black_42: I was inspired by @Johnathan_Wood1. I was on a flight bored https://t.co/tIemdfTlTl
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 04:26:26 IST 2016,"@FulphilO @HaitianKid79 fair enough. Like I said, I haven't watched film on these guys, just have had people I know speak well of them"
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 04:22:32 IST 2016,@FulphilO @HaitianKid79 not a big fan of those players?
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 04:09:02 IST 2016,"@FulphilO @HaitianKid79 curious for your thoughts on my ""if I were Pace"" next 4 months, Phil: https://t.co/z0rRrZLS4k"
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 04:06:04 IST 2016,@KrisArmstrong1 Spotrac says he has 1 year left on his deal https://t.co/mCy1ktf4jg
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 03:54:04 IST 2016,@DEvanAltman 31?
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 03:53:17 IST 2016,"@DEvanAltman 13 felt high, but a lot of players didn't play all those years"
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 03:52:49 IST 2016,@DEvanAltman 17?
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 03:52:32 IST 2016,@ChiTownTeal1 for most positions short shuttle and 3 cone are FAR more important. Show change of direction and explosiveness.
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 03:47:37 IST 2016,@DEvanAltman 13th?
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 03:46:31 IST 2016,@HalasBearReport @Ditka2ATX yro. Could very well be. I'm personally rooting for lots of QBs and little fast guys in top 10
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 03:44:06 IST 2016,"@HalasBearReport @Ditka2ATX doubt he's there at 11 anyway. I'm all for special talent, which Ramsey is. I just don't consider him realistic."
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 03:38:40 IST 2016,@HalasBearReport @Ditka2ATX MO for Fangio/Donatell is put resources into front 7 and S. Find value CB who fit your mold.
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 03:25:31 IST 2016,"@JamesFox917 @DraftCVL yep. Likely try to add some cheap FA depth there, but would be clear weakness of team IMO"
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 03:24:32 IST 2016,"@CoxSports1 @BearsBarroom I don't really have time to do much more than I already have with it, unfortunately."
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 03:22:58 IST 2016,@CoxSports1 @BearsBarroom you guys can publish it there if you want.  I'd have no issues with that
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 03:22:24 IST 2016,"@KrisArmstrong1 he's still under contract, I thought. Either that or I missed him on spotrac FA list"
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 03:21:59 IST 2016,@Ditka2ATX I'd be shocked if they spend high pick or give big FA contract to CB.
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 03:21:17 IST 2016,"@Rlaw1000 @BullsLegacy I'd be down with that too, if there's one there"
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 03:20:53 IST 2016,"@DraftCVL yeah, had a bit of time this morning"
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 02:52:23 IST 2016,"@Chiguy8506 the more I hear about the draft, the more I think Bears should land instant starter in one of the first 2 rounds."
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 02:48:38 IST 2016,"@martinez3507 most of the re-signings I suggest are just that. Let them earn a spot in camp. If they don't, fine by me."
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 02:46:52 IST 2016,@Chiguy8506 he's likely looking at $15M+ a year.  I think he'll be outside their price range.
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 02:46:28 IST 2016,"@martinez3507 cheap, quality depth who knows the offense.  Makes sense to me. He was solid pre-injury last year IMO"
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 02:41:40 IST 2016,"Not doing any official Bears writing stuff due to time constraints right now, but had some time this morning https://t.co/XkFFvDCtSs"
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 02:41:19 IST 2016,Curious for people's feedback on this mock offseason plan for the Bears. https://t.co/z0rRrZLS4k
Johnathan_Wood1,Sun Feb 28 05:28:28 IST 2016,"@kindafoxyroxy I'm getting a vibe there might be some sarcasm in this tweet.  Dunno why, call it a hunch."
Johnathan_Wood1,Sun Feb 28 04:55:11 IST 2016,@ahoffmann596 @FulphilO I think it's more from OLs than coaching. But he certainly got into bad habits through both. Some have improved.
Johnathan_Wood1,Sun Feb 28 04:54:12 IST 2016,@ahoffmann596 @FulphilO which is common for QBs who have played behind so many bad OLs. Started to see that a bit out of Rodgers last year
Johnathan_Wood1,Sun Feb 28 04:53:18 IST 2016,"@ahoffmann596 @FulphilO yep, fantastic arm, but can be a bit scattershot on deep balls b/c of bad habit of poor mechanics."
Johnathan_Wood1,Sun Feb 28 04:50:31 IST 2016,"@ahoffmann596 @FulphilO he can throw a beautiful deep ball, but it's not consistently where it needs to be."
Johnathan_Wood1,Sun Feb 28 04:50:12 IST 2016,"@FulphilO either way, rankings stuff is pretty meaningless, IMO. He's good enough to win with, put a good team around him and go win."
Johnathan_Wood1,Sun Feb 28 04:49:41 IST 2016,"@FulphilO but if he continues smarter decision making from last year, you could argue lower-level top 10 QB IMO"
Johnathan_Wood1,Sun Feb 28 04:49:04 IST 2016,"@FulphilO TO issues seemed to be put behind him last year, we'll see if that lasts. Deep ball accuracy still a concern IMO."
Johnathan_Wood1,Sun Feb 28 04:48:39 IST 2016,"@FulphilO statistically, he's never produced at that level. Largely due to TO and deep ball accuracy issues."
