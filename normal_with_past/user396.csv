lufcanne,Sun Feb 21 15:20:51 IST 2016,@FredgoldMartin Wooton isn't our only problem but singling players out for abuse doesn't help anyone imo. Aim it at them who r to blame
lufcanne,Sun Feb 21 14:56:15 IST 2016,@Michael88445 so give Evans the abuse. Abusing players not big not clever not called for. And wtf difference does not being on here make?

lufcanne,Sun Feb 21 04:27:45 IST 2016,@NDizz_ yes no sign of the beautiful season some prat promised fans
lufcanne,Sun Feb 21 04:26:03 IST 2016,Ffs get off Wootons back. He didn't score og on purpose and doesn't ask to be played oop. He gets picked and does his best
