JC_3D,Tue Mar 01 05:29:43 IST 2016,@ArthurGillard It's all of them. It wasn't like 1 of them was defective. I tried them different times. Never found a focus dial sweet spot
JC_3D,Tue Mar 01 05:27:34 IST 2016,@ArthurGillard They've all been great. I used the first 3 Gears daily at multiple companies I consulted at. The newest GearVR is the problem
JC_3D,Tue Mar 01 04:11:37 IST 2016,I've never had problems with the GearVRs before. Now I just can't use it :( I feel cross-eyed afterwards. No sickness. Just blurry vision.
JC_3D,Tue Mar 01 04:10:13 IST 2016,"I did demos last week and I could instantly tell the difference between the innovator edition and the ""Gear VR"" based on my eye discomfort."
JC_3D,Tue Mar 01 04:07:27 IST 2016,Can someone explain to me why the latest @SamsungMobileUS #GearVR makes everything look blurry to me? At first I thought it was a knock off.

JC_3D,Sat Feb 27 22:19:16 IST 2016,"@virtrealitytime @tipatat 4D?...That's disappointing. As long as they don't call it 5,6, or even 7D. It would be really ridiculous."
JC_3D,Sat Feb 27 13:12:23 IST 2016,@vr_sam We got one of those heads in our office! We should get more for all our HMDs
JC_3D,Sat Feb 27 13:11:03 IST 2016,@natemitchell I love Hearthstone! It inspired me to design a game like it for #VirtualReality Glad this was announced. I just want to play!
JC_3D,Sat Feb 27 13:03:22 IST 2016,Gotta make sure to check out @SUPERHOTTHEGAME...looks Superhot and fun
JC_3D,Sat Feb 27 12:54:27 IST 2016,@futuretown_io @TwitchVancouver I played VR minigolf tonight! So cute and fun. I've been wanting to go mini golfing but that got me my fix
JC_3D,Sat Feb 27 12:50:37 IST 2016,@futuretown_io So this means that @oculus will be capable of room-scale #VR  #VirtualReality!! ðŸ˜€ I knew it
JC_3D,Sat Feb 27 11:29:40 IST 2016,"@brianrose @tiltbrush I also had to pee real bad. Maybe tmi, but it was soo much fun, I didn't want to get out, so I held it in for too long"
JC_3D,Sat Feb 27 11:28:44 IST 2016,"@brianrose @htcvive @tiltbrush Hah That's cool! I wanted to lay on the floor and paint beige strips over me like a mummy, but I got hungry"
JC_3D,Sat Feb 27 11:21:42 IST 2016,@SVVR2016 Need anymore testers? :)

JC_3D,Fri Feb 26 23:14:27 IST 2016,At @OffPlanetVR I played @SeeVividly's mobile game/test that showed me how good my vision is. Incredible! Felt like a workout for my eyes
JC_3D,Fri Feb 26 23:12:19 IST 2016,@PalmerLuckey Yaaaaaas! This is how I'll be spending my Friday nights.

JC_3D,Thu Feb 25 11:33:15 IST 2016,@amberroyVR @oculus but I finally found it and ended up really liking the new sleek look. I was probably just too used to the old version
JC_3D,Thu Feb 25 11:28:03 IST 2016,"@amberroyVR @oculus I saw the new menu tonight! First reaction was ""woah"". I couldn't figure out how to get to the home screen at 1st >_>"

JC_3D,Thu Feb 25 10:44:01 IST 2016,@ArthurGillard My favorite tests were acetylene torch cutting. 10 people cutting at the same time meant bright colored flames and sparks!
JC_3D,Thu Feb 25 09:03:50 IST 2016,I'm having a blast at @oculus playing the latest demos. The touch controllers continue to blow my mind! I can't wait for my Rift to come in
JC_3D,Thu Feb 25 05:55:24 IST 2016,Creating this vent totes reminded me of when I used to be on a competitive metalwork team 8 yrs ago. I miss welding! https://t.co/DMpc3WMks5
