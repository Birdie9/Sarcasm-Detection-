QBKlass,Tue Mar 01 05:26:03 IST 2016,derrick henry has such a terrifying physique for an rb that people expect him to break every tackle and get mad when he doesnt
QBKlass,Tue Mar 01 05:25:13 IST 2016,"he ""plays smaller than his size"" when you expect him to break every tackle, sure https://t.co/otiIiqxE3P"

QBKlass,Tue Mar 01 00:50:52 IST 2016,@finalthrd the problem w/ No.4 is they themselves can heavily influence the scheme/line and what theyre capable of accomplishing

QBKlass,Mon Feb 29 02:19:44 IST 2016,"@Tmac1Nonly temple is one of his worst games, iirc. He isnt outstanding but I like him as qb1"
QBKlass,Mon Feb 29 02:19:06 IST 2016,@studythetape @finalthrd he runs like a goof though
QBKlass,Mon Feb 29 02:17:54 IST 2016,@studythetape lmao yeah. Obvi havent seen too much soccer yet but matuidi is prob my favorite midfielder to watch
QBKlass,Mon Feb 29 02:13:27 IST 2016,@Tmac1Nonly these are shades of tannehill
QBKlass,Mon Feb 29 02:12:49 IST 2016,"@studythetape that makes a lot of sense. Still think he's great, just not necessarily *all* he's cracked up to be. Isnt he only like 22 tho?"
QBKlass,Mon Feb 29 02:04:15 IST 2016,"@studythetape true. Vs bayern, it looked like he was a player who likes to hold his first touch and bayern pressed too much to allow it"
QBKlass,Mon Feb 29 02:02:05 IST 2016,@studythetape is he overrated as an offensive controller in the midfield?
QBKlass,Mon Feb 29 02:01:39 IST 2016,@Tmac1Nonly iono I think this is just a misfire. He didnt reset well when he had time to
QBKlass,Mon Feb 29 02:00:28 IST 2016,pogba playing better today than he did vs bayern
