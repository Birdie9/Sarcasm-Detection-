dboehringer,Thu Sep 01 05:29:27 IST 2011,All in all I believe the #Wenger supporters have had their faith in him more than repayed. #Arsenal #OneArseneWenger #EGGEERRS #COYG!!!
dboehringer,Thu Sep 01 05:26:41 IST 2011,"Obviously I wanted either one of Hazard, Gotze or Moutinho, but Arteta has quality, creativity and premier league experience. #EGGEERS!!!!!!"
dboehringer,Thu Sep 01 05:24:56 IST 2011,"We've got the depth needed to make a challenge on all fronts, with experienced players who will work hard for the shirt. #EGGEERRS!!!!!!!!!!"
dboehringer,Thu Sep 01 05:23:02 IST 2011,"I've always believed in him and have never wavered in his support, because he's done so much for the Arsenal. #InWengerIAlwaysTrust!!!"
dboehringer,Thu Sep 01 05:21:56 IST 2011,"Came home from work to some great news. Spend some fucking money you asked? He spent about Â£50 mil this summer, haters!!!"

dboehringer,Thu Sep 01 05:02:03 IST 2011,"RT @czarsenal: Arsene's next presser; walk in slowly, sit, clear his throat and say, calmly ""15 years you fuckers. I'm still the man."" # ..."
dboehringer,Wed Aug 31 22:08:25 IST 2011,"Arteta wouldn't be the signing that would've blown me away today, but I will settle for Arteta. #eggeerrs"
dboehringer,Wed Aug 31 22:06:57 IST 2011,"Seems it would be too hard to sign anyone not in England now, unless they're already on their way from the continent."
dboehringer,Wed Aug 31 22:05:40 IST 2011,"Looking like no Hazard or Gotze, maybe in January if their clubs don't make it through the group stages."
dboehringer,Wed Aug 31 21:59:20 IST 2011,"@negooner nope, he hasn't yet #eggeerrs"
dboehringer,Wed Aug 31 21:53:09 IST 2011,Why don't they just release Almunia?  No one wants him and they need the roster spot?
dboehringer,Wed Aug 31 14:12:03 IST 2011,"Don't think Gotze will happen, nor Hazard. Wish Wenger would be in for Moutinho. Kid is a monster and a direct replacement for Cesc."

dboehringer,Wed Aug 31 08:17:42 IST 2011,@sdreddevil Per Mertesacker. He's a 6'6'' tall center back who is a starter for the German national team.
dboehringer,Wed Aug 31 03:56:50 IST 2011,Super tired still after a good nap. Culinary arts class is not going to be fun tonight. #EGGEERRS!!!
dboehringer,Wed Aug 31 03:32:29 IST 2011,"Nice to have a big German footballer at the Arsenal again. We still miss you, Jens!!!"
dboehringer,Tue Aug 30 23:54:32 IST 2011,@MorningPint I think his timing and ability will compensate for the lack of speed. I rate him higher than any of the English CB targets.
dboehringer,Tue Aug 30 23:42:52 IST 2011,Running on two hours sleep. Gotta nap before culinary arts class tonight. Hope to see more news when I wake up. #EGGEERRS!!!
dboehringer,Tue Aug 30 23:22:28 IST 2011,Very excited about all the activity. Mertesacker is someone I've wanted at the Arsenal for a while. Hope more to come!!! #EGGEERRS!!!!!!!!!!

dboehringer,Tue Aug 30 06:46:14 IST 2011,Mayweather might be undefeated but it should be with an asterisk because he's afraid to fight Manny Pacquiao.
dboehringer,Tue Aug 30 06:43:00 IST 2011,Watching the first episode of 24/7 and I'm even more disgusted with Floyd Mayweather. Hoping that Victor Ortiz whips his ass!!!
