cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 14:09:29 IST 2016,@Architeinstein @BonsaiSky Peaceful discourse is meaningless if there's a constant threat of violence over your head.
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 14:06:34 IST 2016,"@Architeinstein @BonsaiSky I already said no, not supporting your solution to racism =/= supporting racism."
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 14:04:27 IST 2016,@Architeinstein @BonsaiSky Prove rehab is the solution instead of convincing him peacefully. You're assuming the proper solution.
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 14:03:28 IST 2016,"@Architeinstein @BonsaiSky Okay, you said before this was about restricted freedoms. Now you reversed it, are you admitting you're wrong?"
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 14:00:37 IST 2016,"@Architeinstein @BonsaiSky So their freedom wouldn't be restricted, I'm glad we agree."
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 14:00:12 IST 2016,"@Architeinstein @BonsaiSky Prove, morally, you or anyone else has the right to jail him."
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 13:58:24 IST 2016,@Architeinstein @BonsaiSky Oh you're a Poe. Never mind.
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 13:57:43 IST 2016,"@Architeinstein @BonsaiSky ""Right to freedom"" what are you on about? What freedom was restricted? She could walk away..."
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 13:56:47 IST 2016,"@Architeinstein @BonsaiSky @BBCNews Okay, it was for humor. Prove it's okay to jail someone for humor that you don't like."
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 13:56:12 IST 2016,@Architeinstein @BonsaiSky @BBCNews Is it moral? No. That doesn't mean that you should be caged for it.
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 13:55:14 IST 2016,@Architeinstein @BonsaiSky @BBCNews The burden of proof is on you and the gov that they have the right to cage people for it.
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 13:54:56 IST 2016,"@Architeinstein @BonsaiSky @BBCNews That's not the question, the question is about whether I can be put in a cage for it."
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 13:54:30 IST 2016,"@Architeinstein @BonsaiSky @BBCNews You don't know it was for humor, he seemed very serious to me. When did he say it was about a joke?"
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 13:50:48 IST 2016,"@Architeinstein @BonsaiSky @BBCNews The question is whether the law is just not whether it exists, why would anyone debate its existence?"
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 13:50:15 IST 2016,"@Architeinstein @BonsaiSky @BBCNews That's not what I asked, who said anything about humor?"
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 13:44:07 IST 2016,@Architeinstein @BonsaiSky @BBCNews Should gov's be able to assume someone might break the law and therefore reprimand or detain them?
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 13:43:14 IST 2016,"@Architeinstein @BonsaiSky @BBCNews Right, an assumption that his ideas or words would incite violence despite him not inciting violence."
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 13:42:14 IST 2016,"@Architeinstein @BonsaiSky @BBCNews Exactly, generalized policies like this are open to widespread abuse by gov. laws must be exact."
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 12:38:53 IST 2016,@Architeinstein @BonsaiSky @BBCNews An example of jail based on assumptions and 'precautions' rather than justice sure. A brave new world.
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 12:37:02 IST 2016,"@Architeinstein @BonsaiSky @BBCNews Same reasoning could be used on Muslims as much as anyone else, invites gov abuse."
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 11:37:42 IST 2016,@Architeinstein @BonsaiSky @BBCNews To say this is worth arresting over is equal to an idea of thought crime aka 1984
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 11:37:07 IST 2016,"@Architeinstein @BonsaiSky @BBCNews No because the man hasn't done anything further, neither of us can 'know where it leads'."
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 11:33:53 IST 2016,"@Architeinstein @BonsaiSky @BBCNews Except he never incited a riot now did he? He didn't threaten anyone, didn't even give a first name."
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 11:33:19 IST 2016,@Architeinstein @BonsaiSky More like I disagree with you. Call it whatever you want.
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 09:41:41 IST 2016,@_ThatGuyT I can understand voting for him from a bird watcher's perspective.

cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 07:07:46 IST 2016,@xizzyxhellx @AutismSociety @dhmapplethorpe Just saying maybe you should quit the crusade as you don't represent spectrum people.
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 07:07:06 IST 2016,"@X_Aeon_X ""Nice try feed"" she's arguing with nobody right now I guess."
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 07:05:54 IST 2016,@notch @Zython86 Might depend on the context bb. ;)
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 06:45:55 IST 2016,@xizzyxhellx @AutismSociety @dhmapplethorpe Most spectrum people I know don't like anyone with a stick up their ass.
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 02:52:02 IST 2016,"Cruz wants to patrol ""Muslim neighborhoods"", basically telling terrorists they just have to move out of a ""Muslim neighborhood"". lol."
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 02:49:36 IST 2016,@TrueNugget @FalseNugget @Jenn_Abrams Hence the lack of data showing intimate ISIS involvement.
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 02:49:20 IST 2016,"@TrueNugget @FalseNugget @Jenn_Abrams It seems to me that ISIS cared logistically about the Brussels attacks, not about Bernardino."
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 02:45:09 IST 2016,"@TrueNugget @FalseNugget @Jenn_Abrams The pattern I'm seeing is significant figures in terms of warfare on ISIS. EU, France, U.S."
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 02:43:21 IST 2016,"@TrueNugget @FalseNugget @Jenn_Abrams I mean, that happened because they lived there not because of specific targeting."
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 02:40:43 IST 2016,@TrueNugget @FalseNugget @Jenn_Abrams Such as?
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 02:39:09 IST 2016,@FalseNugget @TrueNugget @Jenn_Abrams Yeah it's weird people are saying that...they hit Paris and Brussels both high security targets.
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 00:59:19 IST 2016,@navin_ryan @RubinReport @Nero @benshapiro You're never going to understand Nero or Ben by talking to people on Twitter.
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 00:50:48 IST 2016,So you support restrictions on free speech and unsavory opinions. Got it. https://t.co/2dsGhC1NBm
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 00:47:40 IST 2016,@Architeinstein @BonsaiSky Article just legalizes gov. harassment of unsavory opinions or rude conversation. Truly frightening prospect.
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 00:46:01 IST 2016,@Architeinstein @BonsaiSky @BBCNews 'Duty' does not translate to 'gov right to place rude people in cages'
cremedelameme09,Fri Mar 25 23:48:47 IST 2016,@BonsaiSky I've spoken up for other free speech cases plenty. Why do you assume no one defending his free speech is Muslim? I am.
cremedelameme09,Fri Mar 25 23:33:24 IST 2016,@joederosacomedy So only non-White Muslims can respond as well about your opinions? Do you have something against White Muslims Joe?
cremedelameme09,Fri Mar 25 23:30:02 IST 2016,"@BonsaiSky The response isn't equal, locking people in cages is NOT what The Prophet would do just because someone was rude."
cremedelameme09,Fri Mar 25 23:29:22 IST 2016,@BonsaiSky So you think people should be arrested for being rude? How is that not a police state? Such practices shame Islam.
cremedelameme09,Fri Mar 25 23:28:36 IST 2016,@Architeinstein @BonsaiSky @BBCNews Where does a gov. then draw a line? Where your preferences end and a white man's begin?
