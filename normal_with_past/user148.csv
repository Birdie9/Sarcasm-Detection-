Charlotte_Stein,Wed Mar 23 05:28:49 IST 2016,Cannot wait to see what Warner do now. Hopefully they start by sacking Snyder.
Charlotte_Stein,Wed Mar 23 05:25:24 IST 2016,Man I wish people threw that much money at me for fucking up as spectacularly as he has.
Charlotte_Stein,Wed Mar 23 05:24:39 IST 2016,"Dear Hollywood, when are you going to accept that Zach Snyder is a useless hack? How many billion dollar franchises does he have to destroy?"
Charlotte_Stein,Wed Mar 23 05:23:37 IST 2016,https://t.co/s2sQdzCV1S Fuck.

Charlotte_Stein,Wed Mar 23 01:32:35 IST 2016,@Kris10Callihan @MeganErickson_ I could probably make a book out of one long conversation. I have to shush them to get the plot moving.
Charlotte_Stein,Wed Mar 23 01:09:23 IST 2016,@Kris10Callihan @MeganErickson_ Of course I hate the part where I have to fill where everybody's arms and faces are. But other than that: üëç
Charlotte_Stein,Wed Mar 23 01:08:21 IST 2016,"@Kris10Callihan @MeganErickson_ Oh my god. Since I started doing this, I enjoy writing like 900% more."

Charlotte_Stein,Tue Mar 22 05:39:50 IST 2016,Oh and now Carol is going too great just great. Knew I was right to give up on this arsehole of a show.
Charlotte_Stein,Tue Mar 22 05:37:39 IST 2016,@millercallihan Thank you mah agent! The encouragement helps.
Charlotte_Stein,Tue Mar 22 05:34:38 IST 2016,So mullet got to be super brave and save the day I see I see ok.

Charlotte_Stein,Tue Mar 22 05:00:42 IST 2016,"But an actually interesting, fun character with a real chance at some sort of progression gets the arrow in the eye. Ok."
Charlotte_Stein,Tue Mar 22 04:59:38 IST 2016,I don't even know the names of these two dudes. I call them ginger beard and mullet. That's how little they mean.
Charlotte_Stein,Tue Mar 22 04:58:46 IST 2016,"So let me get this straight: the two completely expendable white men on the show are still fine, but the only fat gay girl is dead. Got it."
