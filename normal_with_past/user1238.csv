kelly_c_roache,Sun Feb 28 07:28:30 IST 2016,@rmcgibbo and perhaps beyond the best uses of Twitter! There are some good excerpts on subject from latest Angela Davis book I'll track down
kelly_c_roache,Sun Feb 28 07:26:13 IST 2016,@rmcgibbo not sure why not turning up more recent results but I will pass along as I find
kelly_c_roache,Sun Feb 28 07:25:45 IST 2016,@rmcgibbo but trend today is less intersectionality of identity than principle-not individ experience but worldview (ex econ equal+feminism)
