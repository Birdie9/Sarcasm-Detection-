BarryWaller61,Tue Mar 01 05:29:59 IST 2016,@andystrickland wow a lot of negative energy for a team that's still one of the best in the NHL.
BarryWaller61,Mon Feb 29 05:46:10 IST 2016,@Jim_Everett @jthom1 @HBalzer721 Rosen kind of resembles a young Jim Everett eh?
BarryWaller61,Mon Feb 29 05:43:59 IST 2016,@Jim_Everett @jthom1 @HBalzer721 Is this the LA Rams future quarterback? https://t.co/v2OOz3UJws

BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 11:57:53 IST 2016,@AlGiordano @LisaBloom it's also the main reason that people want to conceal and carry weapons.
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 11:56:11 IST 2016,@Frank_Cusumano @KSDKSports yeah but the big O could do so much more then shoot. And no three-pointers.
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:56:09 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @daniklup and Marshall Faulk never ran the ball? Eric Dickerson? They won when they ran the ball
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:54:55 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @daniklup clearly you're just another ignorant but opinionated fan that I'm wasting my time even trying to educate
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:54:02 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @daniklup and whether or not you play outside has nothing to do with building an offense.
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:53:02 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @daniklup again you clearly did not see the mess that Jeff Fisher took over when he came here to St. Louis.
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:52:02 IST 2016,"@craftyguy2 @daniklup almost everyone of your ""observations"" is completely wrong clearly to anyone who was actually there"
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:51:27 IST 2016,"@craftyguy2 @daniklup again Trent Green was awesome in 2000 when he played, even though he wasn't even 100% yet"
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:50:58 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @daniklup no one would agree with you on any of this that is actually seen any of it. Or can  read statistics
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:50:28 IST 2016,"@craftyguy2 @daniklup Dick Vermeil A great coach, though his record doesn't show it. And it was Al Saunders / Martz style offense in KC"
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:48:50 IST 2016,"@craftyguy2 @daniklup as far as Fisher calling him a ""complete failure"" is of course nonsense based on his entire career again just opinion"
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:48:01 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @daniklup I don't think you actually watched too many games especially back then
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:47:36 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @daniklup and green brought with him a big salary to Kansas City
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:47:19 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @daniklup Trent Green sucked so much for the Rams in a small sample that the Chiefs gave up the 12th overall pick to get him
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:46:39 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @daniklup if you judge head coaches on winning percentage Martz one of the better ones
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:46:01 IST 2016,"@craftyguy2 @daniklup statistics don't always lie, The statistic show you were wrong .show me ones that don't?"
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:45:24 IST 2016,"@craftyguy2 @daniklup so again you did not ""suck"" in fact he was great when he played. Over 14 yards per reception . D was terrible"
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:44:27 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @daniklup in 2000 The only time you got to start because of injury in St. Louis he was better than Warner. 101.8 rating 16 td
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 22:52:44 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @daniklup are you aware that the Chiefs gave the Rams the 12th overall pick for Trent Green?
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 21:37:42 IST 2016,"@craftyguy2 @daniklup I get it you hate Mike Martz without knowing anything about his coaching ability, history or using any facts."
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 21:36:35 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @daniklup I clearly remember Ike Bruce pounding his fist on the turf when Green got hurt. They knew what they had .
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 21:35:30 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @daniklup and you clearly did not watch Trent Green in the 1999 preseason to see how great he was.
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 21:27:33 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @daniklup and in some of those interviews I was standing right there asking the questions.
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 21:27:17 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @daniklup and every number shows you're wrong. Imagine where all the principles said at the time in interviews
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 21:26:53 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @daniklup again I don't think you really watch the team back then all that closely Based on everything you say
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 21:26:30 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @daniklup with Warner back in 2001 they scored 37 less points but the defense went back to where it was in 1999 if not better
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 21:25:08 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @daniklup actually scored more points in 2000 1999 with Warner the whole year But gave up over 200 more on defense.
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 21:23:51 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @daniklup it was the defense that went downhill mostly that year. That and Warner throwing lots of interceptions
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 21:23:03 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @daniklup you simply have no facts to support your opinion. The Rams offense lost nothing when green stepped in in  2000
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 21:22:12 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @daniklup from everything you say you clearly weren't watching those guys then up close at least .
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 21:19:11 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @daniklup when he came to St. Louis he was excellent whenever he played. He just got hurt. And once he was healthy  he was good
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 21:18:09 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @daniklup he's the one that finally got them to play Green in Washington that walk year and he was good
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 21:17:32 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @daniklup Martz was not the offensive coordinator in Washington. He was the QB coach
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 21:16:26 IST 2016,"@craftyguy2 @daniklup Trent Green never got a chance to play till age 28 with the Redskins, with a bad team he had a pretty good rating"
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 11:22:50 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @daniklup Mike Martz specifically wanted green as his quarterback as a condition to come here.
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 11:22:22 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @RamsNFL @daniklup and both Mike Martz and DV said many times they would have had the same success with Trent Green
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 11:21:46 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @daniklup in 2000 starting five games green had 16 touchdowns  and five interceptions. Warner had 21 TD 18 Int. That year
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 11:18:35 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @daniklup Kansas City 13-3 in 2003 with that same offense under Trent green
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 11:17:40 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @daniklup also at an older age after a major knee injury Trent Green starred for three years in Kansas City with less talent
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 11:14:56 IST 2016,"@craftyguy2 @daniklup you are aware that Kurt Warner was on the team in 1998 and couldn't beat out Tony Banks, right, .. before Martz."
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 11:13:12 IST 2016,"@craftyguy2 @daniklup they want to 1999 because they added leaders like Faulk, Timmerman, Bly , Holt , Collins , Green."
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 11:12:04 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @daniklup I could write a book about that year and about the whole Kurt Warner story.
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 11:11:46 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @daniklup Warner was not the team leader in 1999. He was in  2001. And as I said I was in the locker room those years.
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 11:10:41 IST 2016,"@craftyguy2 @daniklup Trent Green was a leader, big-time. So was Jeff Robinson, Grant Wistrom, Isaac Bruce, Conwell, Mike Jones,"
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 11:08:03 IST 2016,"@craftyguy2 @daniklup and you couldn't be more wrong about not having leaders : Pace, lyght, Lyle, Faulk, Timmerman, Farr, Carter, Fletcher,"
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 11:06:16 IST 2016,@craftyguy2 @daniklup this team was 100% behind Trent Green and were devastated when he got hurt because they saw how good they could be
