ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 05:29:31 IST 2016,@ipa81 I have got into a habit of making lists. It helps me to tick off the things I have bought and the things I need to buy
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 05:26:41 IST 2016,@ipa81 Both Ronnie and Honey are good for each other. I like their bond over a short period of time. Now Honey is gonna live with Billy
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 05:25:03 IST 2016,@ipa81 Yippee 😜. At least someone noticed the silly error. It happens
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 05:24:06 IST 2016,@ipa81 I think you are more focuses on TEI than Eastenders. People do make mistakes and I totally understand
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:45:05 IST 2016,@ipa81 I blame Whitney for persuading Lee to take that pub job. I wanted Nancy to have that job. That's destiny for you
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:43:34 IST 2016,@ipa81 Same here. I prefer the second Sam. She was much better than the original and she could actually act
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:42:36 IST 2016,@winkitinks I don't follow no one but I just search the things I wanna find out more. What about you?
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:41:26 IST 2016,@ipa81 Where does TwiNk come into eastenders? It must be your typo error. Hahaha
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:40:07 IST 2016,@ipa81 I loved the scene where Ronnie and Honey cleaned the house instead of going out to do shopping. I loved their partnership
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:38:40 IST 2016,"@ipa81 Yes. I totally agree. What He does for us, it would be our best interest and He's always right"
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:37:01 IST 2016,@ipa81 Yes of course. I already started shopping for the things I wanna get for the holiday but my list very long. I rather start now
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:35:42 IST 2016,@ipa81 I think Nancy is feeling unsecured coz Lee is heading somewhere in his life and Nancy is stuck with her parents
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:34:22 IST 2016,@ipa81 You must have heard that the original Sam Mitchell is coming back for Peggy's funeral. How do you feel about it?
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:33:09 IST 2016,@ipa81 Hahaha. I am just a big shopaholic since teen years. My parents keep saying to control my spending for a rainy day
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:32:09 IST 2016,@ipa81 Yes. My health is my first priority and everything else comes later.
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:31:00 IST 2016,@ipa81 God knows what Nancy is trying to do. She needs to think about her own life than interfering others
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:29:52 IST 2016,@ipa81 It would give me the opportunity to buy new outfits for daily wear and for special occasions
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:29:08 IST 2016,@ipa81 InShaAllah. I would be going only 14 days coz I can't handle hot conditions. Usually we go for 6 wees not this time
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:27:57 IST 2016,@ipa81 Nancy wants Whitney to be out of Lee's life. She thinks she is confused over her feelings  for him
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:26:12 IST 2016,@ipa81 She's just lonely coz she can't handle the fact that everyone is happy with their lives. She's to get a grip
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:25:00 IST 2016,@ipa81 I truly do deserve a holiday after my illness. I need sunshine in my life. Do you have any plans to go on holiday as a family?
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:23:34 IST 2016,@ipa81 I was very touched when Whitney told her about past to Nancy. It was beautifully done with a great lighting tone
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:22:07 IST 2016,@ipa81 That would be an awesome idea. I just can't stand her. I bet she's gonna cause more trouble for Pam and her husband
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:19:56 IST 2016,@ipa81 I wanna go too but I have to wait until July or August time. I haven't been since 2008 coz then I became really ill
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:13:48 IST 2016,"@ipa81 Absolutely. My Bro is off on hols for two weeks with loads of sunshine. It's me, little sis and dad stuck in the UK"
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:12:23 IST 2016,@ipa81 Aunt Babe character is such a waste and she needs to go. That character has no future. I loved the ending
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:11:08 IST 2016,@ipa81 That's my kind of weather. I hope we can finally say goodbye to Winter
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:07:00 IST 2016,@ipa81 Of course you as not disturbing me. I just watched today's episode of EastEnders. What an episode it was
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:06:04 IST 2016,@ipa81 Aww. Thank you for the nice words. It means a lot to me. That's nice. I also had pleasant weather. I think spring is soon approaching
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 03:48:04 IST 2016,"@ipa81 Hi. I'm good and healthy. Alhumdullilah. Cough is just minor and it doesn't bother me. Anyways, how are you? How was your day?"
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 03:31:21 IST 2016,@winkitinks Exactly...I heard about this foundation when I watched a video on YouTube and I never looked back. It's expensive but I love it
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 03:29:41 IST 2016,@winkitinks Me too. I wasn't oily as well. It's one of the best foundation that's available and people are raving about it
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 03:17:29 IST 2016,@winkitinks This is one foundation that I am gonna stick to. It doesn't feel sticky after applying it. I am one happy person
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 03:16:12 IST 2016,@winkitinks I know. I truly loved it and it has to my favourite? How did you find it? Did it help with shine control? Mine kept flawless
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 03:14:42 IST 2016,@winkitinks OK 😊. I won't embarrass you in the near future. It's feels nice when someone ask how I am getting on. You're a nice person
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 03:04:39 IST 2016,@winkitinks Guess what? I put my EL foundation from 8pm and now it's 9.30 pm. My skin still looks flawless and I am glowing. Great results 👌
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 03:00:14 IST 2016,@winkitinks You are so understanding and sweet. Yes. The cough is nearly fading away. The past week have been hard but it's over 🙌
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 02:51:13 IST 2016,"@winkitinks Aww. I hope I am not disturbing you with my tweets to you. I'm good and feeling much better, finally 👌"
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 02:48:54 IST 2016,"@winkitinks Hello dude. How are you? How's things? How's your day coming along? You must be at work, right?"
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 02:37:11 IST 2016,It's wonderful to have Yash and Sam uff @mohitmalhotra9 and @Reyhnamalhotra back on #JamaiRaja 😍. We have missed you so much 🙌
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 01:47:04 IST 2016,Kunj can never be loser. He has a good heart & he can do anything for his family 👌. He's 10 times better than evil Yuvi 🙌 #TashanEIshq
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 01:41:01 IST 2016,What a sequence it was 😍. I loved how #TwiNk fell out of the bed. That was too cute 😛. They are destined to be together #TashanEIshq
