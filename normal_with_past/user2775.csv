Liz_Pecan,Tue Mar 01 05:28:58 IST 2016,So what she did? She got me an extra poster. And said I can have it whenever we can see each other. Just because she saw I was a bit sad.
Liz_Pecan,Tue Mar 01 05:28:03 IST 2016,"Amber heard about how sad I was that I wasn’t able to go to the Kizumono showing, and she happened to be there (even though she’s from SC)"
Liz_Pecan,Tue Mar 01 05:27:23 IST 2016,"Well she came to me at one point and she straightened things out etc etc we’re good now. Flash forward to now, a few years later"

Liz_Pecan,Tue Mar 01 05:26:35 IST 2016,Amber is a really nice girl who got slandered really hard by someone and had everyone turn against her.
Liz_Pecan,Tue Mar 01 05:26:00 IST 2016,"So there’s this girl, Amber. Some of you know her. Some of you treated her really badly. In my dark point in my life, I did too."
Liz_Pecan,Tue Mar 01 05:25:31 IST 2016,"Wow so usually I’d put this on my private but yknow what, I wanna put it here"

Liz_Pecan,Tue Mar 01 05:06:20 IST 2016,">identity as a feminist than her opinion for CP

Almost like they were excited she supportED CP as long as it meant they could shit talk her"
Liz_Pecan,Tue Mar 01 05:05:16 IST 2016,y’all know I have a lot of strong opinions against child porn and it is really infuriating that the journalist chose to focus more on her >

Liz_Pecan,Tue Mar 01 04:57:38 IST 2016,"RT @FujiwaraNoMocha: Like ignoring she's a pro-feminist and SJW, yeah she probably shouldnt be at Nintendo"

Liz_Pecan,Tue Mar 01 04:55:39 IST 2016,"If you’re gonna write an article about a self-proclaimed feminist who supports child porn

FOCUS ON THE LATTER PART MORE THAN THE FIRST"
Liz_Pecan,Tue Mar 01 04:54:34 IST 2016,The way some articles are written makes it seem like people are more excited to bring down any feminist rather than the bad thing they did
Liz_Pecan,Tue Mar 01 04:53:31 IST 2016,"@FujiwaraNoMocha yeah that’s what confused me???

And started talking about her being a “SJW” and having a nose ring before her CP support"
