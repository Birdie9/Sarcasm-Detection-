mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 05:29:59 IST 2016,@ScottTridge maybe it's a kick up the Arse he needs mate. Make him more focused on the next game.  Could not risk him in a huge game 2morrow
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 05:27:50 IST 2016,@ScottTridge can I ask why.  Varela was awful against Lfc on Thursday. His awful positioning and poor defending let them score.
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 05:26:47 IST 2016,@jimmymcbride1 they don't have a vote mate. Like I said early. It's like asking a dad to marry his girl.  It's out of respect not needed
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 05:25:53 IST 2016,We'll lose top 4 tomorrow when we get beat off city.  And hopefully we'll take the headlines on Monday with the announcement of Jose.
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 05:25:07 IST 2016,RT @PabloVitalis: @mrthebomb they won't win me thats for sure. Im pro Mourinho
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 05:23:10 IST 2016,@jimmymcbride1 apparently pre contract signed mate. Makes sense that Scholes actually said live on tv. Give Giggs the job. < last ditch
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 05:20:24 IST 2016,@PabloVitalis I think SAF and Scholes and co are trying to win the mufc fans over to the idea of Giggs.  Jose is number in most fans choices
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 05:02:05 IST 2016,@Sport_Witness so why are people believing the same exact story today. Not Feb 19th.  Simply cos Torres is putting his name to it.
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 05:00:55 IST 2016,"@daveh270 @Keith_Russell he did last Thursday.  Final push for Giggs.  Scholes said straight out ""give Giggs the job"""
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 04:59:57 IST 2016,"RT @Sport_Witness: Again, worth pointing out El Pais said in February that Mourinho signed contract. https://t.co/9pTT0gmnuX"
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 04:59:49 IST 2016,@Keith_Russell exactly mate.
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 04:57:35 IST 2016,@GaffneyVLC @thedavidbyer @footballmcd @diegotorresro exact info that Torres is saying though. Madrid leaked this.
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 04:56:54 IST 2016,"Strange how this Torres leak comes only days after Scholes was on tv saying give Giggs the job! 
Seems Mendes bringing attention back 2 jose"
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 04:53:59 IST 2016,@jay4manutd tbh I believe DiMarzio.  And he's said its done.
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 04:51:28 IST 2016,"@GaffneyVLC @thedavidbyer @footballmcd @diegotorresro the why not comment on this. https://t.co/gl7H0DIuNF

This is weeks ago"
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 04:49:44 IST 2016,@pal_united28 I'm betting Robson will be on sky sports tomorrow.  Or Yorke banging on about it.
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 04:48:56 IST 2016,"@gmacca69 follow this link for more.  Then add pay pal. Ha ha. 
Lost me as a follower."
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 04:48:11 IST 2016,@jay4manutd he didn't get the info off Jose.  He got it from Madrid. Madrid wanted him but they found out he's agreed with us.
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 04:47:09 IST 2016,@KayDMusiQ @CheGiaevara @Hannah_D94 but at least he won't have the pack of wolves in the media at him all the time.  Scholes and co
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 04:46:20 IST 2016,@gmacca69 red issue just use us for click bait.
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 04:45:53 IST 2016,@gmacca69 it was done when DiMarzio said it mate
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 04:45:18 IST 2016,"Here is the link to football insider saying what Torres said but 3 weeks ago. 

https://t.co/gl7H0DIuNF"
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 04:44:38 IST 2016,"@StanCollymore hi Stan. Football insider said this exact thing on Feb 19th 
https://t.co/gl7H0DIuNF"
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 04:41:35 IST 2016,Who said Jose had signed a pre contract already.  It was 2-3 weeks ago.  But Torres is not the 1st
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 04:40:40 IST 2016,"@jay4manutd I have.  It's info from Madrid.  ""This pre contract"" got mentioned weeks ago."
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 04:37:32 IST 2016,@jay4manutd yet a paper very well respected has ran the story
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 04:36:43 IST 2016,"RT @CheGiaevara: And yes, El Pais a big, big paper in Spain. Who usually don't report stuff without it being well sourced. So this should b…"
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 04:36:20 IST 2016,@StanCollymore thoughts Stan. Dimarzio said a while ago it was done
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 04:35:27 IST 2016,@KayDMusiQ @CheGiaevara @Hannah_D94 not think it's out of respect. Like asking the father of your girlfriend if you can marry her.
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 04:33:59 IST 2016,@thedavidbyer @GaffneyVLC @footballmcd @diegotorresro to put pressure on SAF and Bobby.  Show the fans want him more than ever
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 04:32:15 IST 2016,"RT @CheGiaevara: So when it comes to Mourinho and the Spanish press, yes, I think Diego Torres is one of the most reliable."
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 02:27:59 IST 2016,@IdMjones @daveh27 I would prefer lukaku but can't remember if him and Jose ended on good terms.
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 02:23:36 IST 2016,@IdMjones @daveh270 can't see Kane been an option.  Go for Zlatan. He'll be amazing.  Cantona type role.  Inspire Rashford and Keane
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 02:02:42 IST 2016,"RT @MiguelDelaney: Mourinho has identified Kane as his main transfer target, should he get the United job https://t.co/doQTaOat3l and https…"
mrthebomb,Sat Mar 19 20:17:09 IST 2016,"@guvnor12 I do believe SAF is backing Giggs to have the job. And using Scholes to feed the press negativity.  
Surprised Rio opted Jose"
mrthebomb,Sat Mar 19 20:16:09 IST 2016,RT @MartialTheMan: The new era is near. #MourinhoMUFC https://t.co/TZgyrLaK9t
mrthebomb,Sat Mar 19 20:14:20 IST 2016,"RT @Sport_Witness: BT just seem to have inadvertently shown aggro among Arsenal fans over 'It's Arsenal FC, not Arsene FC' banner."
mrthebomb,Sat Mar 19 20:13:43 IST 2016,"@guvnor12 I think it has to be a clean sweep.  
Giggs go manage a Cardiff or Swansea."

mrthebomb,Sat Mar 19 19:15:23 IST 2016,"LVG was using Giggs heavily because the plan was always Giggs taking over.  
It was never LVG fail and Giggs take over."
mrthebomb,Sat Mar 19 17:15:18 IST 2016,@keithhasson1 for 80mil some one could violate me.
mrthebomb,Sat Mar 19 15:38:13 IST 2016,@DavidAmoyal @DiMarzio sorry to bother mate.  Just I scanned thru both and saw nothing.
mrthebomb,Sat Mar 19 14:16:49 IST 2016,@TheCityIsRED1 with Berta as well.
mrthebomb,Sat Mar 19 14:13:53 IST 2016,@thegazbewing @mourinhxed yes. A man of his arrogance would of refused Giggs in the 1st place. Not give him such a big role
mrthebomb,Sat Mar 19 14:13:01 IST 2016,Has @DiMarzio said Jose has signed a 3 year deal with us? Can't find it on his timeline. @DavidAmoyal
mrthebomb,Sat Mar 19 14:09:09 IST 2016,"@thegazbewing @mourinhxed ""we make a game plan"" not I do.  Giggs is heavily involved."
