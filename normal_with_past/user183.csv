davidmreimers,Wed Mar 23 05:29:59 IST 2016,@DanielGannon Councillors with Green-Left SJW agendas are actively leveraging council authority to block development.
davidmreimers,Wed Mar 23 05:29:07 IST 2016,"@DanielGannon Exactly. Independence is one thing, but ultimate councils are a delegated authority from state govts."
davidmreimers,Wed Mar 23 04:34:17 IST 2016,@TerryBarnes5 @themetresgained Close to $500m on an electronic patient records system which is behind schedule + has fatal security flaws
davidmreimers,Wed Mar 23 04:28:43 IST 2016,@TerryBarnes5 @themetresgained The amount of $ wasted by the SA Govt alone on failed/delayed IT projects in health is astounding.
davidmreimers,Wed Mar 23 04:06:28 IST 2016,"@portusprince @GrayConnolly Steeply? I can offset a flight to Melbourne for a few dollars. If it rises more than that, someone is making $"
davidmreimers,Wed Mar 23 04:04:19 IST 2016,@GrayConnolly @dannolan I recall the UK in the early 90s having similar issues - houses worth less than its owner's mortgage
davidmreimers,Wed Mar 23 04:00:42 IST 2016,@DanWillsTiser @theTiser @SALibMedia Hopefully this plan will also include maximum turnaround times for DAs. 8 months + is not uncommon.
davidmreimers,Wed Mar 23 03:58:49 IST 2016,@KevCorduroy Kudos for being one of the few journos actively digging into NXT.
davidmreimers,Wed Mar 23 03:57:30 IST 2016,"@AdelaideMP There’s lots of opposition to further hi-rise dev in inner-city. Some from NIMBYS, but also from those with vested interests."
davidmreimers,Wed Mar 23 02:29:08 IST 2016,Without the slightest hint of irony that 'Education Revolution' was lifted straight from The West Wing. https://t.co/eqi10GDbjh
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 16:13:46 IST 2016,@TheRealGG09 Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 15:56:18 IST 2016,"@wadelaube @GrayConnolly When Rudd imitated the Barlett WW they omitted Leo, who was the sole adult influence."
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 15:52:21 IST 2016,@TheRealGG09 You say you don't drink anymore?
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 15:38:20 IST 2016,@GrayConnolly @wadelaube Harsh but fair
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 15:00:13 IST 2016,"@GrayConnolly Or, would you want the passed to a Josh Lyman type?"
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 14:54:24 IST 2016,@KevCorduroy You're gamer than I am. Blessed are the early adopters...
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 14:52:13 IST 2016,@mikesmithson7 He's known about delays 4 yrs - they deliberately delayed construction phase 2 keep CFMEU workers in jobs until '14 election
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 14:49:51 IST 2016,"@SquigglyRick This is a sign. It is telling you to visit @GaziRestaurant Cnr Flinders and Exhibition St, just under that shiny thing."
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 14:47:58 IST 2016,RT @James_Jeffrey: A very special anniversary https://t.co/RrqmKrwx1Q
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 14:43:32 IST 2016,"@KennellyPeter Usually, it's 'I'm a retired Telstra engineer and failures like this are impossible unless done deliberately'"
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 14:42:33 IST 2016,@KennellyPeter It's about now all the tinfoil-hatters emerge saying this is a govt conspiracy to see how people react when Comms are down.
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 14:41:27 IST 2016,Have we had Waleed's take yet
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 14:40:39 IST 2016,@TurekAndrew The backlog is close to 25 years now. It was 18 when they came to power and promised to fix it.
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 14:37:47 IST 2016,Seems like every time I step away from Twitter for a couple of hours something major happens
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 14:37:01 IST 2016,@RobertCandelori Hewson lost an unloseable election. His qualifications are non-existent.
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 10:52:09 IST 2016,"@RichardEdinger @montaguethecat @TheIPA The left have no problem with unions essentially dictating ALP policies, but squeal at IPA, CIS etc"
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 10:29:46 IST 2016,@MarzipanPrincss When I was there a few weeks ago I was amazed how busy the CBD was at 10:30 on a Monday night.
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 09:49:44 IST 2016,@TheRealGG09 You can pickle them
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 08:26:05 IST 2016,@DavidLeyonhjelm It makes me wonder who is bankrolling him.
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 07:55:43 IST 2016,@steviep8746 I stopped listening to Peter when he insisted ALP would ‘probably’ win in 2013 - it wasn’t even close in the end
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 07:42:41 IST 2016,@RobertGCarling Should be explained to ordinary voters how it is no different them claiming a tax deduction for work-related expenses.
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 07:40:24 IST 2016,@montaguethecat And not once did the interviewer even question his claims.
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 07:39:57 IST 2016,"@montaguethecat Prof Q was on ABC radio one day, proclaiming of “cheap renewables” squeezed out by “billions in subsidies to fossil fuels”."
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 07:39:16 IST 2016,"@wadelaube Wild animals become lazy when they are fed and don’t need to forage, so become reliant on being fed. This is the press gallery."
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 07:34:39 IST 2016,@montaguethecat Much like Professor Quiggin’s ill-informed pontificating on the electricity network
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 07:30:20 IST 2016,Went to Haighs and thought I saw Nick Xenophon until I realised there were no TV cameras nearby
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 07:03:43 IST 2016,@pleasedontatme I thought the utilities were just being lazy
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 06:25:01 IST 2016,Thrilled to discover I will be working all week and the on first day of the long weekend NOTHING WILL BE OPEN
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 06:15:12 IST 2016,@SimonJCowan the opposition to comp tax cuts is often ‘it just means bigger profits for businesses’ rather than ‘it decreases their costs'
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 06:12:06 IST 2016,@SquigglyRick It is as if they learnt nothing from watching the RGR debacle.
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 05:57:31 IST 2016,@SimonJCowan Do you have any other info on it?
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 05:52:46 IST 2016,@smurray38 and they send you the letter saying you’re not eligible
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 05:52:07 IST 2016,"@smurray38 The most insulting thing is, when adding a newborn, they insist you apply for FTB even though you know you’re not eligible"
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 05:51:07 IST 2016,Such a shame that government departments seem to mostly buy Indonesian-made paper nowadays https://t.co/rZax2WgqCe
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 05:49:44 IST 2016,@maddythecatlady or apple have acquiesced and they’re attempting to cover it up
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 05:49:17 IST 2016,"@matthewlesh in Adelaide, anything more than 3 stories or mixed-use and the NIMBYs are out in force. One reason why SA is economically dead."
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 05:48:25 IST 2016,"@matthewlesh I’m amazed at the diversity of development in inner-Melb (Sth Yarra, Sth Melb etc) compared to Adelaide."
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 05:42:07 IST 2016,"@ActinideAge Also, a dislike of capitalism. ‘You can’t trust that companies will properly maintain the plants for the 50-year lifespan'"
davidmreimers,Tue Mar 22 05:25:49 IST 2016,@TheRealGG09 Noticed his hair looked decidedly greyer of late. But doesn’t have that same unkempt eyebrows problem that Howard once did.
