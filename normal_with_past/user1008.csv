universityball,Mon Feb 29 19:42:48 IST 2016,Here's hoping he learned a lesson about ball security from the linemen. https://t.co/T4euqRosb0
universityball,Mon Feb 29 19:40:43 IST 2016,Really want a montage of AG's second half buckets set to either Eye of the Tiger or old Nintendo power-up sounds. He looked back.
universityball,Mon Feb 29 08:21:48 IST 2016,has Malcolm Brogdon won anything tonight?
universityball,Mon Feb 29 08:00:57 IST 2016,@astormsabrewing looked like an arm injury.
universityball,Mon Feb 29 07:59:28 IST 2016,@astormsabrewing Came on to close out today's game on the mound & hurt it before recording an out. Couldn't complete throwing motion after.
universityball,Mon Feb 29 07:57:32 IST 2016,"@KyleGardiner I don't know anything about the broadcast. I heard more of the not gay than usual last night, & someone asked me to speak up."
universityball,Mon Feb 29 07:54:12 IST 2016,@BPretendenhall @KyleGardiner a mixture of the two. the students aren't the issue. they moved to f-tech like a decade ago.
universityball,Mon Feb 29 07:53:45 IST 2016,@BPretendenhall @KyleGardiner I'm assuming the issue is older people who don't understand the FTech but remember the other and jump in.
universityball,Mon Feb 29 07:51:06 IST 2016,"thankfully, ECU had five of the seven errors. Hope Robbie Coman's OK, doubly because it's his last go-round."
universityball,Mon Feb 29 07:50:25 IST 2016,"Takeaways from the baseball I was able to pay attention to today: Doyle and Haseley were great, more errors than total runs means it's Feb."
universityball,Mon Feb 29 07:38:58 IST 2016,"@UVaKareBear I know about ""F Tech"", but there was clearly some ""not gay"" last night. Was asked to speak up. Did."
universityball,Mon Feb 29 07:31:10 IST 2016,"@KyleGardiner I don't think this is the students. I know about ""fuck Tech,"" that's been around for a while now."
universityball,Mon Feb 29 07:30:19 IST 2016,@DavidAStorm @Tim_STL @cwdarney I didn't even hear about that when it happened. Reading now.
universityball,Mon Feb 29 07:25:17 IST 2016,"@Tim_STL @cwdarney I don't think it's the students. they take the heat (and issue the ""fuck Tech""s) but the ""not gay"" remnant is older fans."
universityball,Mon Feb 29 07:21:21 IST 2016,"@The_Superhoo yeah, I know about ""fuck Tech,"" which is why I was surprised about the amount of ""not gay"" I heard last night."
universityball,Mon Feb 29 07:18:24 IST 2016,"@cwdarney I went through football season without hearing it, but it's been slightly more of a thing at basketball games."
universityball,Mon Feb 29 07:17:31 IST 2016,@cwdarney good. maybe I was imagining things. I'd rather it not have happened.
universityball,Mon Feb 29 07:15:16 IST 2016,"@cwdarney yeah, the Tech thing's always there now (and I'm not a fan either), but ""not gay"" seemed pretty clear up in the 300s."
universityball,Mon Feb 29 07:12:55 IST 2016,And that's all I have to say about that. Enjoy the Oscars. https://t.co/3M7TfuhBCZ
universityball,Mon Feb 29 07:11:39 IST 2016,"@enjoymoreradio it sounded pretty ""not gay"" from those around me. I wish it was ""fuck Tech"" too, though even that's not really great."

universityball,Sun Feb 28 22:57:39 IST 2016,@Suraj757 well done (and happy birthday!)
universityball,Sun Feb 28 22:20:17 IST 2016,"@CavalierBlue that report of him blocking more shots in practice than the rest of the team has in games this year is a good start, though."
universityball,Sun Feb 28 22:19:52 IST 2016,@CavalierBlue I don't know what to expect from Mamadi in '17 so I'm just kind of starting low and will build based on whatever I see/hear.
universityball,Sun Feb 28 22:19:16 IST 2016,@CavalierBlue I agree. Marial could also be the third in the Death Star lineup if Mamadi isn't quite ready next year.
universityball,Sun Feb 28 22:12:34 IST 2016,@CavalierBlue I have a hard time seeing Nichols highlights without geeking out over the defensive potential of a Nichols/Wilkins frontline.
