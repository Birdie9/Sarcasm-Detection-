tha_rami,Tue Mar 01 02:29:19 IST 2016,I just messed up a thing in the Nuclear Throne community and I'm so thankful that they're so patient with me sometimes.

tha_rami,Tue Mar 01 00:12:07 IST 2016,"@aurahack At 95+dB? I mean, places get loud, for sure - but not 'loud music loud' I feel? I don't know, never went and measured that"

tha_rami,Mon Feb 29 05:57:23 IST 2016,"Elon Musk's musing about AI must've pissed off the sentient on-board computer, because that was about the most anti-climatic abort sequence."

tha_rami,Mon Feb 29 05:43:02 IST 2016,"@NihiLTV Then the dynamic music systems, art, porting to different platforms, cert, etc. took an additional 6-7 months."
tha_rami,Mon Feb 29 05:42:13 IST 2016,"@NihiLTV Oh, the core game was done in a month, and the design/dev of the missions, airplane types, battle flow & the like took a year-ish."
tha_rami,Mon Feb 29 05:32:10 IST 2016,"@NihiLTV It was a 2 year project that we worked on pretty much fulltime, but obviously sometimes a game is just not someone's style."
