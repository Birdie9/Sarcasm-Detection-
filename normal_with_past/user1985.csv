Mike_Tuckerman,Tue Mar 01 05:22:28 IST 2016,"Indeed, @dasher39. But riddle me this. If 127k are willing to watch women's soccer on a Monday night, how accurate are #aleague ratings?"
Mike_Tuckerman,Tue Mar 01 04:14:03 IST 2016,Congrats to @TheMatildas on a great win in Osaka last night! A good start to the qualifying campaign. Here's hoping a #Rio2016 spot beckons.
