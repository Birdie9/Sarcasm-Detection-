RyanJMcGinleyFG,Mon Feb 29 05:15:15 IST 2016,@RyanJMcGinleyFG The SDs are ones to watch. Appeal to young people - particularly.
RyanJMcGinleyFG,Mon Feb 29 05:14:12 IST 2016,FF and the SDs are the real beneficiaries of this election #GE16
RyanJMcGinleyFG,Mon Feb 29 05:03:08 IST 2016,FF's triumph is solely down to Mich√©al Martin. Any impending heave discredits any integrity in the party #GE16

RyanJMcGinleyFG,Sun Feb 28 11:30:28 IST 2016,@RyanJMcGinleyFG Any heave is completely unwarranted.
RyanJMcGinleyFG,Sun Feb 28 11:29:57 IST 2016,"If someone told you in 2011 FF would be the largest party in 2016, you would have laughed. Mich√©al Martin deserves huge credit #GE16"
