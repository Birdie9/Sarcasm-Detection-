djspiewak,Tue Mar 01 05:29:39 IST 2016,@michaelg It seems a lot more likely that this is a crowd-sourced training bias (unconscious or conscious) from Netflix's users.
djspiewak,Tue Mar 01 05:29:10 IST 2016,@michaelg What I think is interesting is the article ends by strongly suggesting this is a consequence of unconscious bias among the devs.
djspiewak,Tue Mar 01 02:51:47 IST 2016,@milessabin @runarorama You might be able to trick it into happening outside the REPL by wrapping each statement in an object.
djspiewak,Tue Mar 01 02:13:03 IST 2016,@milessabin @runarorama Preliminary guesswork is that it's related to the bug where an object and a type have same name.
djspiewak,Tue Mar 01 02:12:45 IST 2016,@milessabin @runarorama I wonder if this bug can be lifted in some way to actually achieve linear types…

djspiewak,Sat Feb 27 02:05:19 IST 2016,@GoblinGame @lagergren I suppose this is true. The goal then would be to be optimize for a higher number of vectors whenever possible.
djspiewak,Sat Feb 27 01:29:44 IST 2016,@GoblinGame @lagergren I like to think that almost anyone I interact with knows more than I do along AT LEAST one vector.
djspiewak,Sat Feb 27 01:29:12 IST 2016,@GoblinGame @lagergren This is one of the beautiful things about intelligence: there is no one axis along which it can be quantified.

djspiewak,Sat Feb 27 00:58:49 IST 2016,@aaronmblevin @stuartsierra I can certainly come up with plenty of cases where implicit conversions are awful. This is not one of them.
djspiewak,Sat Feb 27 00:58:32 IST 2016,@aaronmblevin @stuartsierra This isn't a problem with implicits. It's a problem with integer overflow and dumb numeric types.
djspiewak,Fri Feb 26 03:56:29 IST 2016,@aurosan @rit It's creative if nothing else. I'd give them an interview just on that basis alone.
djspiewak,Fri Feb 26 03:52:21 IST 2016,@rit I don't think ClassTag is serializable.
djspiewak,Fri Feb 26 03:41:45 IST 2016,@haspemulator @runarorama I'd be very surprised if any public transit solution approaches Transit for its use case.
djspiewak,Fri Feb 26 01:55:29 IST 2016,@tlockney @deech Exactly. It also demonstrates respect for someone’s domain of interest when you take the time to learn the syntax/semantics
djspiewak,Fri Feb 26 01:44:50 IST 2016,"And yet, despite zfs.ko being a perfectly reasonable piece of software, it probably IS in violation of the kernel's license. Which is stupid"
djspiewak,Fri Feb 26 01:44:09 IST 2016,"The kerfuffle over zfs.ko is exactly why I dislike GPL. This is clearly not what the ""derivative works"" clause was intended to achieve."

djspiewak,Fri Feb 26 01:36:39 IST 2016,"@deech Mostly, all you need to do is be able to present yourself at a level where the expert feels they can talk to you as a peer."
djspiewak,Fri Feb 26 01:36:04 IST 2016,@deech I try to familiarize myself with every significant area of the field to the level where I can at least hold a conversation.
djspiewak,Fri Feb 26 01:17:14 IST 2016,"@kubukoz Indeed! Teaching is a fantastic way to ensure that you really know something, not to mention seeing it from different angles."
djspiewak,Fri Feb 26 00:54:18 IST 2016,"The dual of the previous is that almost everyone has AN exceptional area of expertise. When you meet someone, find that area and learn."

djspiewak,Wed Feb 24 23:23:46 IST 2016,"I'm very disappointed that ScalaDays still doesn't cover speaker travel expenses. Effectively, speakers pay THEM for the privilege."

djspiewak,Wed Feb 24 05:54:16 IST 2016,@lowellheddings They know that fiddling around with ads for a few weeks isn't going to make anyone switch to Mac/Linux.
djspiewak,Wed Feb 24 05:53:50 IST 2016,@lowellheddings Almost certainly a trial balloon. Microsoft needs to cultivate alt revenue streams from their existing dominance.
djspiewak,Wed Feb 24 02:14:35 IST 2016,@extempore2 Ah that's fair. Also I don't think dtrace works on the Linux kernel.
djspiewak,Wed Feb 24 02:13:25 IST 2016,@extempore2 FUSE seems like overkill. Also I had no idea that FUSE still worked (reliably) on Mac.
djspiewak,Wed Feb 24 02:12:40 IST 2016,"@extempore2 The next step would be to take anything not in that dtrace output and chmod -x. After that, removal."
