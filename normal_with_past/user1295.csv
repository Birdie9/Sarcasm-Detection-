FSkornia,Tue Mar 01 04:54:09 IST 2016,@godaisies Aww. I actually really like the new @metmuseum logo.
FSkornia,Tue Mar 01 04:22:56 IST 2016,Patrons helping patrons at the print release station. There is still goodness in the world. #librarylife
FSkornia,Tue Mar 01 04:20:08 IST 2016,"I love @bookavore's check for regency romance, ""... figure out if the hero is a duke or earl or some other peer of the realm..."" :-)"
FSkornia,Tue Mar 01 01:29:33 IST 2016,Google's Leap Day Doodle today is really cute. Nice job Google.
FSkornia,Tue Mar 01 01:20:13 IST 2016,"I finished Bachman's/King's ""The Long Walk"" last night. Abrupt ending, but this would be high on a list of Stephen King's lost treasures"

FSkornia,Mon Feb 29 08:56:17 IST 2016,What are the odds that AMC is going to begin selling brake light pendants on their #TheWalkingDead store now?
FSkornia,Mon Feb 29 08:28:12 IST 2016,Rick and Daryl are going all Seven Samurai here... #TheWalkingDead
FSkornia,Mon Feb 29 08:12:41 IST 2016,"I've said it before, as much as I love all the respect Mad Max is getting, it's hardly the film I expected to break the genre barrier"
FSkornia,Mon Feb 29 08:10:11 IST 2016,Seems that the white patriarchy is thriving in the apocalypse. Rick had his cop's intuition when he didn't talk to Gregory #TheWalkingDead
FSkornia,Mon Feb 29 08:02:06 IST 2016,I guess not... #TheWalkingDead
FSkornia,Mon Feb 29 08:01:25 IST 2016,Is that Mount Vernon? #TheWalkingDead
FSkornia,Mon Feb 29 07:49:20 IST 2016,@MyOutsiderVoice :-) Thanks
FSkornia,Mon Feb 29 07:45:02 IST 2016,Big question for #TheWalkingDead: are we ever going to find out what happened to Daryl's motorcycle and crossbow?
FSkornia,Sun Feb 28 08:38:43 IST 2016,@Tuphlos This is why I haven't finished  The Expanse yet. The 2 hour finale is intimidating.

FSkornia,Sat Feb 27 02:55:05 IST 2016,"@actinginthelib With that coloring book, I'd expect Jammy Dodgers."
FSkornia,Sat Feb 27 02:39:10 IST 2016,"@dropvase I wonder whether there is a difference in how gamers (board, roleplaying, video, etc) view failure from non-gamers"
FSkornia,Fri Feb 26 22:58:56 IST 2016,"I think that Stephen King's (as Bachman) ""The Long Walk"" would do pretty well as a YA Hunger Games-genre book today. #fridayreads"
FSkornia,Fri Feb 26 22:18:26 IST 2016,@CopyrightLibn Sounds like a good time to introduce him to spoonerisms and Rindercella.

FSkornia,Fri Feb 26 20:39:57 IST 2016,@nicolefonsh You win the responsibility of having to do it at every meeting in the future! #truestory
FSkornia,Fri Feb 26 20:36:08 IST 2016,Sad that a short notice trip from the library means I'll miss the first #litachat with @MTbeekeeper. You all should still tune in at 1 EST!
FSkornia,Fri Feb 26 20:29:46 IST 2016,@miriella Yup! My music player actually followed up the Gladiator track with one from King Arthur and I laughed out loud
FSkornia,Fri Feb 26 08:36:46 IST 2016,The first movie score that I REALLY listened to was Hans Zimmer's score to Gladiator. I still get chills listening to tracks from it

FSkornia,Fri Feb 26 04:06:31 IST 2016,"@Reblogga Cool! Have fun with the making and cheese. Not so much the wine (I don't drink either, so I understand you there)"
FSkornia,Fri Feb 26 04:05:22 IST 2016,@Reblogga Ooh! Where?
FSkornia,Fri Feb 26 03:25:02 IST 2016,So Twitter changed the favorite to Like. Then Facebook ramped up the Like button. What's next? Twitter glitter bombs? When will it end?!?
FSkornia,Fri Feb 26 02:56:34 IST 2016,@sotomorrow I was actually thinking of MM in Dazed and Confused :-) And I'll always pick MM over JF (even creepy MM in True Detective)
FSkornia,Fri Feb 26 01:42:05 IST 2016,"@sotomorrow I remember when Matthew McConaughey played a (almost) high school stoner, and now he plays Jessica Chastain's father"
FSkornia,Thu Feb 25 22:22:03 IST 2016,@laurendodd @psyckology I remember unpacking after a move with pros and was astonished by what they wrapped and packed.
FSkornia,Thu Feb 25 18:35:09 IST 2016,"So does anyone else see the contradiction in saying the GOP should try to stop Trump, but the Dems should be open minded about Sanders?"
FSkornia,Thu Feb 25 09:47:34 IST 2016,"With that being said, I do have an extra bed at the Grand Hyatt Denver if anyone wants to room w/ me and split the cost. #pla2016"

FSkornia,Thu Feb 25 03:42:27 IST 2016,"@Leannarenee Cool! It's rare to see characters age much over the course of a series, so is a treat to see."
FSkornia,Thu Feb 25 03:08:57 IST 2016,"@Tuphlos Or even better, those two layer covers (1 layer w/ head, 1 w/o head), so you can ""behead"" the characters yourself!"
FSkornia,Thu Feb 25 03:07:59 IST 2016,@Tuphlos I'm now picturing all my book covers with headless characters on the front. Would definitely work for A Song of Ice and Fire!
FSkornia,Thu Feb 25 02:55:29 IST 2016,@whimsylibrarian The best answer I can think of is be consistent w/ the rotations. Familiar faces at the same times each day. @librarified
