SRHazelwood,Sun Sep 01 05:29:49 IST 2013,Fitzhum rolls out and sprints into the end zone for a 6-yard TD run as time expires. Harris connects on the PAT.
SRHazelwood,Sun Sep 01 05:28:54 IST 2013,LOL there is ONE second left in the half. Panthers get one play right here to try and get on the board ...
SRHazelwood,Sun Sep 01 05:28:22 IST 2013,"SMCC gets 32-yard pass from Fitzhum to Derek Cook to the Flyer 5-yard line. No idea on how much time is left, but it's well under a minute."
SRHazelwood,Sun Sep 01 05:24:00 IST 2013,"Scottie Slauterbeck to Bob Harwood, 14-yard touchdown pass. STP 14, SMCC 0, inside of 2 minutes we think (scoreboard problems). @Fandydotcom"
SRHazelwood,Sun Sep 01 05:21:07 IST 2013,Scottie Slauterbeck to Bob Harwood for a 35-yard gain to the SMCC 20. Inside of three minutes in the half ...
SRHazelwood,Sun Sep 01 05:19:43 IST 2013,"This game has ground to a halt. St. Paul 7, SMCC 0, 4:09 2nd. SMCC just turned it over on downs at the St. Paul 33."
SRHazelwood,Sun Sep 01 05:07:39 IST 2013,"SMCC defense holds strong yet again. 9:25 left in the second quarter, and the Panthers take over on downs at the 22. Still trail 7-0."
SRHazelwood,Sun Sep 01 04:58:59 IST 2013,"End of the 1st quarter: St. Paul 7, SMCC 0. @Fandydotcom"
SRHazelwood,Sun Sep 01 04:58:36 IST 2013,"SMCC defense held, but buried in shadow of own goal post, forced to punt again and St. Paul has it at their 35."
SRHazelwood,Sun Sep 01 04:50:52 IST 2013,Now SMCC has a punt blocked ... Flyers are going to have a 28-yard field.
SRHazelwood,Sun Sep 01 04:48:40 IST 2013,A missed FG and a botched punt attempt costing SMCC early. Not the recipe to win at this particular venue on Saturdays.
