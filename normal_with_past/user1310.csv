Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 05:29:48 IST 2016,@jfwduffield It's a travesty conservative elites insist on pushing him out of the race when he's clearly the most electable (and likeable).
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 05:28:51 IST 2016,"@jfwduffield Mainly from pundits. He is clearly very smart, but also ideologically flexible to an extent that's difficult to believe."
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 05:22:03 IST 2016,@jfwduffield At least Chuka knew when to quit...
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 05:21:33 IST 2016,@jfwduffield Am a Kasich fan so still holding out hope. Jeb! would have been an ideal candidate.
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 05:16:41 IST 2016,"@jfwduffield I genuinely hope Rubio isn't the nominee, so it might be undue pessimism talking. Trump has exceeded expectations everywhere."
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 05:15:29 IST 2016,"@jfwduffield It's an exceptionally formidable coalition - both geographically and demographically. Not without weaknesses, though."
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 05:14:09 IST 2016,"@jfwduffield Underperforms tomorrow, Rubio wins some states, massive ad blitz in FL and two-man race going west - Trump's weakest area."
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 05:11:30 IST 2016,@jfwduffield He does - and his exclusive dependence on the suburbs is a major obstacle going forward.
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 05:07:30 IST 2016,"@KevinMFeeney @DFosterEvans Plus, the jokes are so, SO bad - like IDS 2003 conference speech bad."

Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 05:03:36 IST 2016,"@KevinMFeeney We'd normally have seen some leaked internal polling by now, unless they really are that good at managing expectations."
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 05:02:52 IST 2016,"@KevinMFeeney I think this ""secret"" tape could hurt Trump badly, but unclear cui bono - him or Cruz."
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 04:55:20 IST 2016,"@KevinMFeeney Could see that. I simply can't believe that Cruz would fare so badly in his home state, or that Rubio couldn't break 20%."
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 04:54:14 IST 2016,@jfwduffield Equally possible - it's basically just a hunch I have.
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 04:50:14 IST 2016,"@KevinMFeeney Agreed. I don't think it will be, but Emerson aren't alone in having Cruz narrowly ahead and Rubio below 20%."
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 04:45:05 IST 2016,"I maintain Trump will underperform significantly tomorrow, but I have no empirical basis for it whatsoever."
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 04:42:27 IST 2016,"If the final result is even remotely close to this, I can't see how Cruz's campaign goes much in to Wednesday.

Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 03:57:17 IST 2016,@DFosterEvans @KevinMFeeney That paradox seems oddly familiar...
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 03:55:07 IST 2016,@KevinMFeeney @DFosterEvans Still not had a single interaction with a Bernie Bro :(
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 03:51:34 IST 2016,@KevinMFeeney @DFosterEvans Oh sure - they do exist. Trump has probably lulled them in to a false sense of electoral security.
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 03:46:17 IST 2016,@KevinMFeeney @DFosterEvans Or a Republican President+Republican Congress; as a Sanders nomination would likely mean.
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 03:40:40 IST 2016,"@KevinMFeeney @DFosterEvans Yes, and undermining the rationale for his campaign in the process."
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 03:37:40 IST 2016,"The Buzzfeed story is an October Surprise in March - deeply unethical, but could well sink Trump."
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 03:32:39 IST 2016,RT @daveweigel: Sounds like SECRET TAPE might have Trump saying what he said on the record to Byron York. https://t.co/9ifp7rJH4x https://t…
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 03:29:01 IST 2016,"Flagrant disregard for journalistic ethics aside, this whole ""secret"" tape story will damage Trump far more than any other gaffe."

Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 02:52:59 IST 2016,RT @Taniel: Trump gets a 3rd House endorsement: Tennessee's Scott DesJarlais. If that name sounds familiar—well it should: https://t.co/b1j…
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 02:31:28 IST 2016,"@DFosterEvans @KevinMFeeney Agreed - southern firewall even higher than previously thought, and MA #s looking good too."
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 02:30:37 IST 2016,@KevinMFeeney @DFosterEvans But they were conducted in the pre-Yo' Mama phase of the campaign - could have been a gamechanger.
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 02:29:11 IST 2016,"@KevinMFeeney @DFosterEvans VA demographically favourable to him though (not that NV wasn't, tbf)."
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 02:27:42 IST 2016,@KevinMFeeney @DFosterEvans You're probably right. Still find the paucity of polling staggering - did everyone assume it would be resolved?
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 02:26:35 IST 2016,@KevinMFeeney @DFosterEvans Definitely a possibility - though he has tended to outperform the polls (NH notwithstanding....)
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 02:25:52 IST 2016,@DFosterEvans DC suburban growth is certainly Trump's biggest problem there. Should perform well outside of NoVA.
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 02:22:04 IST 2016,@DFosterEvans I do reckon Rubio could win Virginia - which would be a coup. Outside chance of GA too.
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 02:17:38 IST 2016,"@DFosterEvans I tend to agree, though it would vary depending on the state. Could swing NC and a few others to Rubio."

Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 02:15:41 IST 2016,Guess would be that Cruz wins TX by a sufficient margin to justify remaining in. Quite who that helps is difficult to say.
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 01:07:53 IST 2016,"I think Cruz will win TX easily, but still an opportune quote."

Americanist9,Mon Feb 29 18:02:07 IST 2016,"@DFosterEvans @KevinMFeeney @PaulFrame85 @AntBreach In Trump's case, a lot would depend on how binding the ""pledge"" was."

Americanist9,Mon Feb 29 17:45:04 IST 2016,@KevinMFeeney @AntBreach @DFosterEvans Isn't it better for the RNC to defeat Trump at the convention? Ballot access impossible by July.
