epictrader,Tue Mar 01 02:10:27 IST 2016,@KatherineLeeds So embarrassing. I'm literally numb here. What sense can anyone bring to bear on such a shambolic performance?#lufc

epictrader,Wed Feb 24 11:32:18 IST 2016,Leeds season over but hopefully Evans keen to give young players like Coyle their chance now. Mulhern and Stokes deserve a go too. #lufc
