ElliottGaal,Tue Mar 01 05:29:24 IST 2016,@RDOG_RULEZ Just finished browsing the files. Some of it is fan art. A few are a bit risqu√©.
ElliottGaal,Mon Feb 29 22:26:24 IST 2016,"@RDOG_RULEZ I have a few friends who've sent lots of artwork.
I'm still going through it."
ElliottGaal,Mon Feb 29 21:26:37 IST 2016,@RDOG_RULEZ Are you interested in Akame ga Kill artwork?
ElliottGaal,Mon Feb 29 19:51:28 IST 2016,"@mollysearcy So what is your boundary for artwork. Don't worry, I'm smart enough to not post mature artwork."
ElliottGaal,Mon Feb 29 19:46:51 IST 2016,"@realkayveedee You are famous in the VA community so that is good.
I'll always remember your first time I heard you, Lucy in Elfen Lied."
ElliottGaal,Mon Feb 29 08:38:04 IST 2016,@realkayveedee I don't know why anyone would unfollow famous and friendly people like yourself and colleagues.

ElliottGaal,Mon Feb 29 07:23:23 IST 2016,"@chrisdpatton I wasn't aware you were into Lay Gaga.
Don't worry, I am jesting."
