Gazzydoo,Fri Mar 18 03:27:43 IST 2016,RT @OptaJoe: 1 - Manchester United have won only one of their last six games in Europe. Fading.
Gazzydoo,Fri Mar 18 03:25:45 IST 2016,"@mufcruleok It will be. Fellaini won't play for United again after this... not until Sunday, anyway. He'll play then, obviously."

Gazzydoo,Tue Mar 15 04:05:07 IST 2016,@UtdBeforeFergie @MerlinUnited @UrmstonLordMUFC I love the idea that Sharp had to borrow the stuff from Ron.. bet he had more than they did.

Gazzydoo,Tue Mar 15 03:04:49 IST 2016,@MerlinUnited @UrmstonLordMUFC @ManUtd @WayneRooney As a youth I never bought anything other than Sharp and it had to be red too :)

Gazzydoo,Tue Mar 15 02:53:04 IST 2016,"@michaelxavick actually a month in calendar terms, but they only play once a week (like we will be doing soon) so it seems longer. :)"
