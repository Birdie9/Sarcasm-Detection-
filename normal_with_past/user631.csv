cfstilettos,Tue Mar 01 05:29:56 IST 2016,@Spectricide That he would vote that way...not a surprise. That he would publicly say so...I'm shocked.
cfstilettos,Tue Mar 01 05:25:05 IST 2016,@ArtistNancyNuce Honestly near tears right now over this.
cfstilettos,Tue Mar 01 05:23:31 IST 2016,@jaybusbee After defending the sport to my friends for years...I am at this moment ashamed to be a fan.
cfstilettos,Tue Mar 01 05:22:41 IST 2016,Wonder what Daniel Suarez thinks about Brian France's endorsement?
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 29 21:33:48 IST 2016,@jeff_gluck Yes!
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 29 09:58:06 IST 2016,Seriously...just....WHAT????
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 29 09:57:47 IST 2016,WHAT?
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 29 09:54:13 IST 2016,@3donutgiraffe Held it in to avoid a conversation I'm still not ready to have with my daughter.
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 29 09:49:43 IST 2016,@3donutgiraffe Trying real hard not to ugly cry after that. Unbelievable!
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 29 09:45:56 IST 2016,I want to keep my little girl home safe with me forever. How am I going to sent her out into the college world.
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 29 09:36:59 IST 2016,@DianneG I suspect it wasn't seen as widely as it deserved to be. Such a painful subject.
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 29 09:28:46 IST 2016,Ohhhhh. Alan Rickman :'(  :'(   :'(
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 29 09:03:42 IST 2016,@DianneG BIG upset!
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 29 08:28:15 IST 2016,The people sitting in front of the winners looked REALLY confused.
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 29 08:24:31 IST 2016,@sgsoutherngurl1 Five. I know this because it is KILLING my Oscar pool :(
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 29 08:01:55 IST 2016,Wow. Oops! https://t.co/UyhTwvTc9K
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 29 08:01:13 IST 2016,"@mathowie Wow! I recognized the music but did NOT think about the significance. And neither, apparently, did the Oscar's musical director."
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 29 07:15:37 IST 2016,@DianneG Fantastic!
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 29 03:28:53 IST 2016,"Don't get to do this too often, so here goes...Thank you @NASCAR for letting the race unfold naturally. Fewer cautions don't mean bad races!"
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 29 03:15:41 IST 2016,Would you look at that? The 18 is your points leader :D
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 29 03:06:57 IST 2016,Coming from dead last to a legitimate shot at the win? 18 team is showing what made them Champs!
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 29 03:04:36 IST 2016,Damn! Without that wreck I think the last lap would have been amazing!
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 29 03:01:25 IST 2016,Holy cow is my heart pounding right now. Does this count as cardio for the day???
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 29 02:57:01 IST 2016,@Spectricide Guess I'm more old school than I thought lol. I LOVE them letting the race unfold as it will.
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 29 02:55:05 IST 2016,THAT is a legit caution! And wow did this race just get interesting.
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 29 02:53:21 IST 2016,Maybe you want to show the car trying to catch the leader instead of just showing the leader?
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 29 02:43:41 IST 2016,Really hope NASCAR does not give into temptation to throw phony late caution. Really interesting race playing out...just let it please!
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 29 02:36:41 IST 2016,@jeff_gluck Do restarts make a race exciting?Yes. Can a race be great without them...absolutely. This race has had a ton of stories!
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 29 02:19:24 IST 2016,Really surprised there isn't a Water Cooler Dale twitter account yet.
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 29 01:29:33 IST 2016,"@rowdygirl1851 From what I can tell, damn caution clock led to wrecks in both the Truck races that have had it so far :("
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 29 01:25:56 IST 2016,"Maybe we can quit complaining about long green flag runs so we don't bring the ""caution clock"" to this series?"
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 29 01:20:29 IST 2016,"Wondering...If you lose a lap bc you aren't scored for it at all, is it even possible to get it back via lucky dog? Anyone know?"
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 29 01:01:43 IST 2016,"@bobpockrass @jeff_gluck When you lose lap because you flat out aren't scored for the lap, is it even possible to get it back via Lucky Dog?"
cfstilettos,Sun Feb 28 07:30:29 IST 2016,@SamanthaBusch @theKBFoundation Already have our bids in :D
cfstilettos,Sun Feb 28 02:08:35 IST 2016,Cue the whiners who only seem to care if a cup driver runs Xfinity when its Kyle that wins.
cfstilettos,Sun Feb 28 02:07:37 IST 2016,WOOOO
cfstilettos,Sun Feb 28 02:03:58 IST 2016,You KNOW NASCAR is looking as hard as they can for debris right now.
cfstilettos,Sat Feb 27 06:25:19 IST 2016,@realtimeRowdy @KyleBusch NOTHING as exciting as watching him when he starts at the back...man on a mission!
cfstilettos,Thu Feb 25 02:07:21 IST 2016,@Spectricide Florida seems to have a monopoly on naked criminals.
cfstilettos,Wed Feb 24 10:57:19 IST 2016,@word_34 @Spectricide The scary thing...you know the number is actually higher. Those are only the ones willing to say it out loud.
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 22 21:14:27 IST 2016,@nbcchicago This is not news.
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 22 09:49:21 IST 2016,@KagroX I don't doubt his ability to blast right through that ceiling
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 22 05:19:05 IST 2016,@SamanthaBusch Look at all those teeth!!!!
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 22 03:36:55 IST 2016,@Spectricide Drunk texting is usually the best texting :p
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 22 03:35:06 IST 2016,@Spectricide YIKES!
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 22 03:31:49 IST 2016,@Spectricide Not just a game when the blood is real :/
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 22 03:29:38 IST 2016,@Spectricide I honestly don't know if I can watch these plate races anymore. Felt sick the entire race.
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 22 03:27:44 IST 2016,@Spectricide Just glad that didn't go bad like some blocks do.
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 22 03:23:29 IST 2016,@GeoffreyMiller @jaybusbee THAT makes me sick.
cfstilettos,Mon Feb 22 03:22:05 IST 2016,"@JayJayDean Wasn't even so much dissent, was a great finish, more of a general statement of disgust with who won lol"
