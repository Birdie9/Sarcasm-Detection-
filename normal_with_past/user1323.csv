Jesse_James77,Tue Mar 01 05:05:40 IST 2016,The free #Pens Penguin is kinda cool and no way I could chuck this to the ice if a hatty happens. #Nosebleeds https://t.co/oGNgl3M5XR

Jesse_James77,Tue Mar 01 03:35:35 IST 2016,@penguins__24__7 it's the internet and people are dicks.
Jesse_James77,Tue Mar 01 01:16:14 IST 2016,Well my youngest will be playing ball with his big brother one more time as he's going to the same college! Makes moving them in easy on me!
Jesse_James77,Mon Feb 29 08:12:51 IST 2016,@yak_face don't even have to read this and know it wasn't Jayson.  ðŸ˜’
Jesse_James77,Mon Feb 29 07:51:21 IST 2016,@peteypitts btw the local collecting group had a get together Saturday at a buddy's place in greensburg.  Always looking for new folks.
Jesse_James77,Mon Feb 29 07:46:26 IST 2016,@peteypitts I have seen Han at Target in Harmar but not the Rey.  I got Unkar today and I need the alien 2-pack and Hassk Thug now.
Jesse_James77,Mon Feb 29 05:47:54 IST 2016,Anyone else curious to see Glenn's early days in the outbreak?  I am.
Jesse_James77,Mon Feb 29 05:40:50 IST 2016,Watching bowlcutboy croak again is fun. #TWD #TheWalkingDead
Jesse_James77,Mon Feb 29 03:11:50 IST 2016,Unkar Plutt looks like a penis in an outfit. ðŸ˜•  Now I just need the alien 2-pack and he Hassk Thug guy.  Maybe Han to customize.
Jesse_James77,Mon Feb 29 03:05:39 IST 2016,"Sooooo like, Star Wars had a guy kiss his sister, but the slightest hint of a possible gay character gets ""fans"" pissy?  Rrriiiiggghhhhtttt."
Jesse_James77,Mon Feb 29 02:52:11 IST 2016,@peteypitts who do u need yet?
Jesse_James77,Mon Feb 29 02:52:01 IST 2016,@peteypitts lotsa Poe and Finn n kylo yet...  And the Han of course.
Jesse_James77,Mon Feb 29 02:51:17 IST 2016,@peteypitts yes!  Mills sorry
Jesse_James77,Mon Feb 29 01:55:31 IST 2016,Someone bought all but a line stormie.  That kinda blows.
Jesse_James77,Mon Feb 29 01:39:47 IST 2016,"In other news I secured Unkar Butt 
huhuhuhuh"
Jesse_James77,Mon Feb 29 01:39:03 IST 2016,"Holy buttload of wave 3 TBS 4"" figures...  Walmart restocked.  How long till bitching about pegwarmers?  #Soon"
Jesse_James77,Sun Feb 28 08:45:14 IST 2016,@Dejan_Kovacevic those numbers...  Oofah.  But sometime it's all about your fit.
Jesse_James77,Fri Feb 26 11:33:09 IST 2016,"@greedo737 @yak_face Good man... I'm cleaning mine up a lil.  The worst one anyway.  I'm not terribly picky, but that one was ugh."
Jesse_James77,Fri Feb 26 10:49:13 IST 2016,"@Dejan_Kovacevic Hah, you wore a jofa helmet at dek too.  Good times in Delmont & Murrysville for me. :)  And Melwood before it burned down."
Jesse_James77,Fri Feb 26 09:24:43 IST 2016,I live in an area swirling with Trump and Cruz supporters.  Be afraid America because 'Murica is a real thing.  And they're batshit.
Jesse_James77,Fri Feb 26 09:21:40 IST 2016,"Cruz's message is simply ""I will obstruct all progress just as the nuts wish!""  FFS Trump is more normal."
Jesse_James77,Fri Feb 26 09:20:24 IST 2016,"Kasich reminds me of the snl skit that had Lovitz as Dukakis saying ""I can't believe I'm losing to this guy""."
Jesse_James77,Fri Feb 26 09:19:20 IST 2016,Ben Carson...  Holy fuck.  This guy sucks.
Jesse_James77,Fri Feb 26 04:49:26 IST 2016,"RT @igorvolsky: .@tedcruz is blocking federal $ for Flint 

BUT in '15 requested federal $ to assist Houston floods (ht @thomas_jd1) https:â€¦"
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 11:10:05 IST 2016,"@mwb1138 Already watched, haha.  I laughed...  kind of annoyed laughter, but it was funny. :)  I just like it alright!!!!"
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 09:02:02 IST 2016,"As tech increases and is able to get smaller n smaller, I think we will someday have light up sabers in 3.75"" that don't look like poop."
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 09:00:37 IST 2016,I've tinkered with light-up figures...  It's rough but I've got 21B where it's workable if I can find a place for batteries.
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 08:55:54 IST 2016,"I see actual light up sabers in the 6""-ish scale are now quite a real thing courtesy of Kotobukiya...  Hmmmm. #StarWars #IGotAnIdea"
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 08:21:55 IST 2016,Not even watching #Pens at this point.  Rather watch #STTNG reruns.
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 08:05:08 IST 2016,@ocb75 @mwb1138 @scottyscottyw Figured these guys could help.  Just beware.  They hoard Porkins or something like that.  #NoClue
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 07:14:12 IST 2016,Just spent like an hour panicking over not having old version of Office still handy.
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 07:09:20 IST 2016,"@scottyscottyw I have copy, I should watch and see.  Hmmm"
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 07:08:47 IST 2016,"@scottyscottyw See, I think (like the resistance) they'd be funded by the Imp Remnant which I figure is still big bank roll."
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 07:07:58 IST 2016,"@scottyscottyw The topps stuff?  Nah, but @ocb75 and @mwb1138 both do that, and are both good friends.  @ocb75 got ICMG made by Hasbro. :)"
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 06:20:31 IST 2016,"@scottyscottyw I believe it's the same in the film, that Poe doesn't fire till his buddy's dead.  I doubt Finn sees who/what."
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 06:19:49 IST 2016,@scottyscottyw So i figure the blasts are probably similar between the two trilogies...  Just something I found interesting.  Oh and...
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 06:19:21 IST 2016,"@scottyscottyw That said, we really don't see close-ups of blaster shots, or even follow-up much.  Leia, Chewie, get bandaged but thats it."
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 06:18:48 IST 2016,"@scottyscottyw IMO the new armor would probably be superior to the old, if possible.  The FO seems to value its people slightly more."
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 05:47:17 IST 2016,At the same time I also find it interesting someone bleeds that much from blaster fire.  Kinda gores up Star Wars a bit.
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 05:46:25 IST 2016,"I find it interesting that Poe killed someone Finn cared about clearly, but then they become friends."
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 05:27:20 IST 2016,Ultra bright rainbow today.  Made me feel oddly happy. #EasilyEntertained https://t.co/enAs5bD2SF
Jesse_James77,Wed Feb 24 09:09:38 IST 2016,"@yak_face yeah, those look fantastic from the first officer of bitching about quality...  Guess who the captain is btw. :P"
Jesse_James77,Wed Feb 24 09:05:11 IST 2016,"So Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is on SyFy and it's kinda tough to tell if its a movie they made themselves ala Sharknado, or just shitty."
Jesse_James77,Wed Feb 24 09:04:01 IST 2016,@Dejan_Kovacevic are you Empire or Alliance in Star Wars?  It's more fun to be the bad guy IMO. #Nerds
Jesse_James77,Wed Feb 24 08:21:26 IST 2016,@greedo737 guy on JediDefender mentioned his were messed up and others who ordered online too.  Weird.
Jesse_James77,Wed Feb 24 08:20:07 IST 2016,"@greedo737 mine aren't like horrid IMO, but I do plan to take a micro brush and some goofoff and clean it up slightly."
Jesse_James77,Wed Feb 24 06:22:25 IST 2016,"@steve_ryall Definitely goofed up. :P  I'm wondering if these were not done by labor, but rather by machine?  For all to have issues. :("
Jesse_James77,Wed Feb 24 05:12:15 IST 2016,"And seriously, I'll take bad paint SA over good paint 5poa...  To each their own on that but I like to ""pose"" (play with) my figs. :P"
