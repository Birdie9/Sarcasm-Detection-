aliciahnaomi,Wed Feb 24 06:36:45 IST 2016,@EllyOcean oh man the Eric Andre show is
aliciahnaomi,Wed Feb 24 02:41:33 IST 2016,@the_rosenrot I can't imagine the right people would be the ones to buy tickets.
aliciahnaomi,Tue Feb 23 10:43:51 IST 2016,I'm becoming Peter Potamus. Did you get that thing? That thing... that I sent you? https://t.co/a7otKAth02
aliciahnaomi,Tue Feb 23 09:00:41 IST 2016,@the_rosenrot I mean more from the perspective that the best attendees may not 'invest' in buying a ticket to a show by an unknown designer.

aliciahnaomi,Mon Feb 22 11:37:21 IST 2016,@yoox my discount code expired as I was checking out :( It was for 25% off. Any chance I could get another code?
aliciahnaomi,Mon Feb 22 11:11:28 IST 2016,@peterpohjola Biek Verstappen - $1200AU. They're up to about 800EUR. Most beautiful scarves I ever saw in my life.
aliciahnaomi,Mon Feb 22 08:56:06 IST 2016,@EllyOcean this is amazing.
aliciahnaomi,Mon Feb 22 08:35:57 IST 2016,Also it's $800USD so it's really a $1200 scarf.
aliciahnaomi,Mon Feb 22 08:35:40 IST 2016,When I was 16 I bought a scarf that cost $45. Everyone was seriously offended at the time because it was so expensive.
aliciahnaomi,Mon Feb 22 08:34:33 IST 2016,When is it okay to buy an $800 scarf? I mean it's no ordinary scarf it's a hand-crafted work of art. That's also a scarf.
aliciahnaomi,Mon Feb 22 08:27:42 IST 2016,@EllyOcean Oh this one is 10/10
