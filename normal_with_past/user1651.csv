NickNice100293,Tue Mar 01 05:29:41 IST 2016,Maybe the @NYIslanders should take some notes on what it's like to be a real sports franchise
NickNice100293,Tue Mar 01 05:29:24 IST 2016,The Rangers don't win every year but they at least put their best effort in trying to win @NYIslanders
NickNice100293,Tue Mar 01 05:28:35 IST 2016,"Another lost season and the fans r gonna coddled with ""wait till next year"" again @NYIslanders"
NickNice100293,Tue Mar 01 05:28:01 IST 2016,If as an organization you don't invest into your team how do you expect the fans to invest their time into a team @NYIslanders
NickNice100293,Tue Mar 01 05:27:18 IST 2016,Then the @NYIslanders want to know y they r always in the bottom of the league in attendance
NickNice100293,Tue Mar 01 05:26:51 IST 2016,But then again as an @NYIslanders fan I'm used to the false hope that the organization creates for its fans
NickNice100293,Tue Mar 01 05:26:17 IST 2016,I can't wait till Pittsburg catches the @NYIslanders in the standings and the islanders miss the playoffs
NickNice100293,Tue Mar 01 05:25:54 IST 2016,"The @NYIslanders are a joke, they will never be taken seriously as an NHL franchise"
NickNice100293,Tue Mar 01 05:25:07 IST 2016,The @NYIslanders know that there team is not good enough to win & they have a few missing pieces with a solid core & do nothing abt it
NickNice100293,Tue Mar 01 05:23:01 IST 2016,The @NYIslanders are the only franchise that believes it's fine to be competitive and in contention but doesn't like to go to the next level
NickNice100293,Tue Mar 01 05:21:22 IST 2016,Worst sports franchise in NY... @NYIslanders hands down! And I'm the idiot who follows them

NickNice100293,Mon Feb 29 00:41:15 IST 2016,@amedaglia7 yea but u have to win now before it's too late so that's ok and exactly you can draft another prospect
NickNice100293,Mon Feb 29 00:40:20 IST 2016,@amedaglia7 and Garth snow is sitting there with is finger up his butt
NickNice100293,Mon Feb 29 00:39:11 IST 2016,@amedaglia7 great move and they didn't give up much that was good
NickNice100293,Mon Feb 29 00:30:23 IST 2016,"Let me guess Garth, the islanders r perfect as is right? We have had too many draft picks in recent years, it's time to win now!"
NickNice100293,Sun Feb 28 20:12:17 IST 2016,The guy could be a freak and out up outstanding numbers at the combine but if he can't play football who cares
NickNice100293,Sun Feb 28 20:11:46 IST 2016,"When you draft someone it should be to draft the best available football player, not the person who had the most reps at the combine"
