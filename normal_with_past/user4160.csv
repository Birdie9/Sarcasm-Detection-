Metsmania,Sun Sep 01 05:29:46 IST 2013,Now if Wheeler unloads here then we can officially say the Nats have been cooled off by none other than the #Mets.
Metsmania,Sun Sep 01 05:20:07 IST 2013,"Just when you think the #Mets have too many 1st basemen, they lose 1 to injury. Same story with the pitchers (starters & pen). #InjuryProne."
Metsmania,Sun Sep 01 05:15:13 IST 2013,I'm not sure how long this will last with the #BabyMets but finally they aren't the bad news bears. I like what I'm seeing. #LGM #Spoilers
Metsmania,Fri Aug 30 18:54:07 IST 2013,RT @_mistermet: Tom Seaver thinks pitchers today should be like him and his Hall of Fame friends http://t.co/e9ZpeAVZ5H via @HardballTalk
Metsmania,Fri Aug 30 17:09:40 IST 2013,Yesterday was a treat by the #Mets with a rare blowout win. The battle for 3rd continues. Our young team will be fun & maddening. #BabyMets
Metsmania,Wed Aug 28 17:33:23 IST 2013,After a bum-hum-bug sports news day it was great to see Niese threw a complete game shutout. The battle for 3rd place continues. #LGM #YGB
Metsmania,Tue Aug 27 23:48:44 IST 2013,Thanks to Byrd & Buck for your 2013 contributions to the #Mets. I know you guys were 1 year rentals but maybe youll see the post season now.
Metsmania,Tue Aug 27 07:30:48 IST 2013,"It would be nice to have the suspended JV1 coming up in this 9th against Papelbum. Oh well, I do hope he enjoys his extended vacation. #LGM"
Metsmania,Tue Aug 27 07:07:40 IST 2013,@SnowMets Flores hasn't had as many opportunities as Turner. If that time comes & fails I'm sure he will get the same treatment. #LGM
Metsmania,Tue Aug 27 07:05:15 IST 2013,"Why is Turner still a #Met, he needs to sit on another teams bench. I know he has had some good days but now he just irks this #Mets fan."
Metsmania,Tue Aug 27 06:33:35 IST 2013,Can't you guys see Terry is over cautious now. After the Harvey injury he isn't  taking any chances with any major pieces of the future.
Metsmania,Tue Aug 27 06:29:06 IST 2013,"@EWilkowski I see a need for RF cause Byrd will be gone, a reliable 1B & SS. Other than that I think the team is covered with a deep bench."
Metsmania,Tue Aug 27 06:17:24 IST 2013,"@EWilkowski I agree, pitching is the key but our bats aren't scaring anyone. With money to play with, above .500 would be nice in 2014."
Metsmania,Tue Aug 27 06:10:37 IST 2013,"@EWilkowski  The same way Harvey & Wheeler stepped up ""ya gotta believe"" at least one of the young guns in the minors will do the same."
Metsmania,Tue Aug 27 06:00:38 IST 2013,"What's a deflated #Mets fan to do when you lose your ace for the unforeseeable future? Keep on rooting for your #Mets, suck it up & move on."
Metsmania,Tue Aug 27 05:40:59 IST 2013,"Once again, you can always count on the #Mets to give a team or a player their 1st. Ashley's first 3 bagger of his career. #ComeOnMets"
Metsmania,Sun Aug 25 23:57:10 IST 2013,"Congrats d'Arnaud, we've been waiting a while for that big hit & boom...there it is. Hopefully that's 1 of many more to come. #LGM #BabyMets"
Metsmania,Sun Aug 25 04:10:09 IST 2013,"Harvey deserved more once again but today it would be nice to get him off the hook for an L, another no-decison would actually be justice."
Metsmania,Sun Aug 25 02:07:10 IST 2013,With all those no-decsions Harvey just might need a rest. Its not like he's going for the Cy Young a-la Dickey of 2012. #CompleteMets2014
Metsmania,Sat Aug 24 07:41:18 IST 2013,"Nice try Dice K, 2 bad you faced an AL team who has seen you since your debut. Oh well maybe they will score runs for Harvey tomorrow. #Sike"
Metsmania,Thu Aug 22 10:42:56 IST 2013,"The Braves lost Hudson & Heyward while visiting Citi this year, that's some key players for a playoff bound team. #CitiFieldOfHorrors"
Metsmania,Thu Aug 22 01:35:25 IST 2013,Now you can chop that up as one of the worse losses of the year (barring a comeback). Terry pushes the wrong buttons more often than not.
Metsmania,Wed Aug 21 23:57:07 IST 2013,Did Lagares not tag up on that? I'm at work.
Metsmania,Wed Aug 21 23:33:15 IST 2013,"Keep on trying Lagares, he's not working with a spaghetti arm, he's legit. #NoDoublesZone"
Metsmania,Wed Aug 21 07:47:59 IST 2013,"Safe travels #Mets fans, we are one game away from a sweep of the division leaders. #LGM"
Metsmania,Wed Aug 21 07:45:11 IST 2013,"Hey Braves what ever you do, don't hit a come backer to Hawkins nuts! #NoCupNoProtection"
Metsmania,Wed Aug 21 07:42:25 IST 2013,"Hawkins must use Cocoa Butter, no ash on them elbows. #DontBlowTheSave"
Metsmania,Wed Aug 21 07:33:05 IST 2013,"Finally some insurance by non other than Ike ""Its my 3rd Bomb since AAA"". #LGM #WinThisGame"
Metsmania,Wed Aug 21 06:52:59 IST 2013,"Its like its 1-0 #Mets all over again & we know how that usually ends. Come on guys, 2nd place at the end of the season will look so good!"
Metsmania,Wed Aug 21 06:49:24 IST 2013,"WTF, so you bring in the guy who is supposed to start Friday? Once again Collins, Bobby V you are not! #IHateTheBraves"
Metsmania,Wed Aug 21 06:38:25 IST 2013,I think MLB needs to check the visas of a couple of these Braves players.... Janish & Terdoslavich. I smell trouble. #USA
Metsmania,Wed Aug 21 06:30:19 IST 2013,Im sure Byrd will get at least a 2 year offer in the offseason but it sure would be nice if he could stay a #Met at least for 1 more season.
Metsmania,Wed Aug 21 06:25:46 IST 2013,"#21, a new career high for the Byrd man. That's what I'm talking about. This time the other pitchers wheels fell of first. Now finish them."
Metsmania,Wed Aug 21 06:23:52 IST 2013,Who needs a hit for RBI's when speed kills & never slumps. #LGM #ICanDigIt
Metsmania,Wed Aug 21 05:37:48 IST 2013,1-0 leads for the #Mets usually means a heart breaking loss for the #Mets late in the game. #ShowMeDifferentMets
Metsmania,Tue Aug 20 19:08:58 IST 2013,"@joshb729 agreed, he hasn't done anything yet, I chalk that up to jitters. Besides Recker is a great back-up so he has nothing sewed up yet."
Metsmania,Tue Aug 20 18:49:13 IST 2013,"Suckers, d’Arnaud just wanted to get his first hit at Citi so he could show #Mets fans who still care what he will do in seasons to come."
Metsmania,Mon Aug 19 23:52:12 IST 2013,"I should be home by the 6th inning, until then #LGM. Score early, score often, a laugher would be nice."
Metsmania,Mon Aug 19 04:43:19 IST 2013,All I know is that the #Mets owe me some sleep for that bust of a west coast trip. All them late nights & not enough wins.
Metsmania,Mon Aug 19 04:34:07 IST 2013,"Well damn, a split with the Padres. Hey Howie, don't put that one in the books."
Metsmania,Mon Aug 19 03:08:21 IST 2013,"That could have been worse. When Harvey isn't at his best he's still more than the rest. Come on #Mets, score some runs & get the man a win."
Metsmania,Mon Aug 19 03:05:26 IST 2013,"@Lets86it me too, the captain needs to be here to restore order."
Metsmania,Mon Aug 19 01:50:17 IST 2013,"Hopefully the #Mets are ticked off from last nights lost & will continue to pour it on & often. No letdowns today, tattoo them Padres. #YGB"
Metsmania,Mon Aug 19 01:48:52 IST 2013,I wonder how different the #Mets pen would look if Francisco was actually trying to get back & pitch instead of his extended vacation.
Metsmania,Sun Aug 18 09:44:09 IST 2013,Is anyone else going to watch the 9th besides me? I'm committed to wins & losses but I thought for sure a sweep of the Padres was in effect.
Metsmania,Sun Aug 18 09:08:50 IST 2013,"I cant front, I was looking forward to a Padres sweep. The game isn't over but if you're watching you felt it was over when it was 4-1. #YGB"
Metsmania,Sun Aug 18 08:32:41 IST 2013,"WTF, Aardvark sucks but the Padres runs themselves out of an inning. Come on #Mets surprise me & win this game."
Metsmania,Sun Aug 18 08:18:37 IST 2013,How about an epic first big league hit rookie! #LGM
Metsmania,Sun Aug 18 08:02:38 IST 2013,It sucks with all the injuries that the #Mets don't have a true long man in the pen right now.
Metsmania,Sun Aug 18 08:01:00 IST 2013,"Its easy to see the wrong pitcher has come into the game. Yeah its the bottom of the 4th but damn, stop the bleeding already. #ComeOnMets."
