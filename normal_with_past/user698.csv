fez_lemur,Tue Mar 01 05:05:03 IST 2016,@gerardway No one wants to fight me. I think it's like saying it to an otter.

fez_lemur,Tue Mar 01 04:10:43 IST 2016,"@mizuki_hana2 @bigwormy @gerardway That's so funny! I kept going ""Where are the snipers? What's going on here?!?"""
fez_lemur,Tue Mar 01 02:30:14 IST 2016,@mizuki_hana2 @bigwormy @gerardway So amazing but so shocked there wasn't more last second bidding. Never seen an auction like that.
fez_lemur,Tue Mar 01 01:19:16 IST 2016,@JanuarySky_ I'll have to download this one to my phone or tablet and draw it tonight.
fez_lemur,Tue Mar 01 01:18:00 IST 2016,@JanuarySky_ Yes. ;)
fez_lemur,Tue Mar 01 01:12:15 IST 2016,@JanuarySky_ I wish I could draw today. . . :(
fez_lemur,Tue Mar 01 01:08:12 IST 2016,@LolaPlusG But I seriously think that's the most ever spent on a Candyland game. For real. ..
fez_lemur,Tue Mar 01 01:07:23 IST 2016,"@LolaPlusG THAT shocked the hell out of me. No sniper bidding. Totally different than any auction I've ever seen--live, on-line, silent."
fez_lemur,Tue Mar 01 01:03:24 IST 2016,@LolaPlusG I'm completely on pins & needles. . . .3 minutes!
fez_lemur,Tue Mar 01 00:09:39 IST 2016,@LolaPlusG @gerardway It's the last hour! It's starting to go a little bonkers! I wonder where it will land?!? My original instinct was $1K

fez_lemur,Mon Feb 29 23:23:11 IST 2016,@JanuarySky_ @RevengeAmy I'll try and take a pic tonight. There's no reason it took me forever. And I'm HORRID at casting off. But it's done
fez_lemur,Mon Feb 29 23:16:07 IST 2016,@gerardway That tweet just sets the tone for a fun and jaunty week! Have a fun and jaunty work day!
fez_lemur,Mon Feb 29 20:38:44 IST 2016,@JanuarySky_ @RevengeAmy I finally finished a scarf I've been working on 4ever. Good to have it done.
fez_lemur,Mon Feb 29 06:22:43 IST 2016,@JanuarySky_ @RevengeAmy I ended up going to the store & doing our budget which was NOT the creative vibe I was hankering for. NOW fun.
fez_lemur,Mon Feb 29 04:38:24 IST 2016,"@LolaPlusG @chantalclaret @gerardway @jimmyurine @lynzway  In 19 hrs, 58 mins it will get crazy & all kinds of $$ will be raised for ACS."
fez_lemur,Mon Feb 29 04:36:03 IST 2016,@LolaPlusG @chantalclaret @gerardway @jimmyurine @lynzway @eBay It would look really cool framed.
fez_lemur,Mon Feb 29 02:21:35 IST 2016,@JanuarySky_ I like the idea of being curled up & knitting....
fez_lemur,Mon Feb 29 01:19:57 IST 2016,@AstridKitten76 @gerardway I haven't. I need to get motivated
fez_lemur,Sun Feb 28 23:41:27 IST 2016,"@gerardway I want to do a making a thing. Should I paint, draw or knit? Or bake?"
fez_lemur,Sun Feb 28 23:23:58 IST 2016,@gerardway Research can be fun. What are researching?
fez_lemur,Sun Feb 28 23:13:45 IST 2016,@gerardway @bigwormy At least you didn't get busted by Umbridge. You know how that detention is.

fez_lemur,Sat Feb 27 23:04:46 IST 2016,@JanuarySky_ @gerardway Nummers!! I'm a bit tempted to join you but it's a bit early for Anchovy olives. Even for me. <3
fez_lemur,Sat Feb 27 23:00:17 IST 2016,@JanuarySky_ @gerardway That's a gorgeous bottle. I would buy that too but for different reasons. Ginger beer market research with Aimee.
fez_lemur,Sat Feb 27 22:50:07 IST 2016,@gerardway March sounds in the very distant. But it's just 4 days away which is freaking me out a bit.
fez_lemur,Sat Feb 27 21:50:10 IST 2016,@gerardway I would 110% buy that. Was it good?
fez_lemur,Sat Feb 27 21:42:21 IST 2016,@AmyWelling You spent time on it & your time is valuable. Your art brings joy to others & they're appreciative of the time you spent.

fez_lemur,Thu Feb 25 23:08:45 IST 2016,@gerardway @skullmandible Uhm the reality of the first couple of years is a bit opposite. I think there's some serious flimflam being sold.
