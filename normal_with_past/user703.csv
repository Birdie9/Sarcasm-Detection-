paulahthion,Tue Mar 01 04:55:59 IST 2016,"@AnnieHardy Catching up on the shows I missed. Sweet piano licks. Apparently, in the army, James Blunt was known as ""Cunty Blunty""."

paulahthion,Thu Feb 25 20:54:37 IST 2016,"@AnnieHardy peppermint oil is said to be a rodent deterrent. After mice trapped, soak cotton balls & place around stove to stop returning."
paulahthion,Thu Feb 25 20:50:11 IST 2016,"@AnnieHardy googled, you should sort it quick, they'll be destroying the insulation, and mouse pee smell will only increase. Traps at back"
paulahthion,Thu Feb 25 20:40:31 IST 2016,"@AnnieHardy ah! Only seemed to happen on side view, but sure you can sort it. To the gaffer tape!"
paulahthion,Thu Feb 25 07:49:42 IST 2016,"@AnnieHardy @periscopeco I couldn't take watching them on the periscope site, the playback controls gave me the aspie twitch."
paulahthion,Thu Feb 25 06:42:17 IST 2016,"@AnnieHardy Sorry I missed BC live, I was out, just catching up now. That side window phoneholder rattles the mic like a motherfucker btw :("

paulahthion,Wed Feb 24 08:56:38 IST 2016,"@AnnieHardy @periscopeco Hella great Band Car episode, thanks Annie!"
paulahthion,Tue Feb 23 22:05:18 IST 2016,@AnnieHardy @lyretherapy I always thought you were more aiming for a sand-in-the-crevice kinda vibe with Band Car :)
paulahthion,Tue Feb 23 00:46:00 IST 2016,@AnnieHardy I've DM'd you a link
paulahthion,Sun Feb 21 08:20:36 IST 2016,"@AnnieHardy Thx for the BC shoutout & new tune, great song, maybe it'll make the extended deluxe version of Annie Hardy Rules :)"
paulahthion,Fri Feb 19 01:20:37 IST 2016,"@AnnieHardy I've been updating that article about living a positive life I'm writing, if you want to check it out."
paulahthion,Fri Feb 19 00:36:38 IST 2016,@AnnieHardy You should maybe find a way to point all these new Periscope peeps at Patreon. Make a sign you can wave in front of the camera!
paulahthion,Wed Feb 17 04:06:56 IST 2016,"@AnnieHardy This one worked better, no dropouts! 1st show missed lots of important words out. Props for the uk-friendly times too, cheers."
paulahthion,Wed Feb 17 01:56:57 IST 2016,"@AnnieHardy audio is much choppier than uStream :( drop outs & skipping, not kewl."
paulahthion,Wed Feb 17 01:40:27 IST 2016,"@AnnieHardy Fan of BandCar, not a fan of Periscope, playback controls suck (there aren't any really). And it seems to be trying to kill you!"

paulahthion,Sun Feb 14 21:06:30 IST 2016,"@AnnieHardy If we priced music on song quality AND amount of pain involved in writing, you could ride around LA on a solid gold pony!"
paulahthion,Sun Feb 14 21:03:53 IST 2016,"@AnnieHardy On a BC request tip, how about The Stooges - I Wanna Be Your Dog"
paulahthion,Sun Feb 14 20:35:58 IST 2016,"@AnnieHardy Maybe money laundering. Bad guys set up many sellers with overpriced things, other bad guys buy them = very hard to trace money"
paulahthion,Sat Feb 13 00:59:41 IST 2016,"@AnnieHardy Cool, always looking for good rules! Glad you liked the parmesan, I checked online recipes & you could definitely make your own."
paulahthion,Fri Feb 12 15:40:11 IST 2016,@AnnieHardy Are there any songs you recorded that aren't going on the album? Maybe one of those for next band car.
paulahthion,Fri Feb 12 15:37:50 IST 2016,"@AnnieHardy @VICE You can't smoke in bars here, but you can't fuck in bars either, so I guess it's kinda fair."
paulahthion,Wed Feb 10 08:09:30 IST 2016,@AnnieHardy I trust AH Rules is gonna include your actual rules somewhere. Have they changed since the PNP days?

paulahthion,Fri Feb 05 06:46:28 IST 2016,"@AnnieHardy The other songs are great too, but I could see a banging BC-type version of Train playing over a scene in a show on The CW :)"
paulahthion,Thu Feb 04 15:32:34 IST 2016,"Hey rest of the world! Nothing you see reported in web adverts as ""taking the UK by storm!"" is actually taking us by storm."
