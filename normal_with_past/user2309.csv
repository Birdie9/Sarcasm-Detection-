transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 04:38:25 IST 2016,"@em_being As a metaphor for posthuman ascension, extended gunplay works surprisingly well. A bliss state, punctuated by bullets."
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 04:34:41 IST 2016,"@em_being It arguably part of the point but Endless Mode removes a lot of the exhaustion. Play as the cathartic reward for ""freedom""."
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 03:27:23 IST 2016,@NEwertKrocker I go milder on grilled cheese. Usually sriracha or just some red peppers.
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 03:25:27 IST 2016,We tell you because you should know that we're here.
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 03:24:56 IST 2016,"Furthermore, we don't mention it all the time. I've mentioned it in one freelance piece and, like, two blog posts."
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 03:23:44 IST 2016,"Like, okay. I'm not really bothered. But if you think gays, racial minorities, or trans people should shy away from their identities? No."
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 03:17:50 IST 2016,"Darling, you're going to be waiting for a while. It will happen when we don't have to fight to justify our existence."
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 03:16:38 IST 2016,"""When can we get articles from trans people that don't point out that fact that they are trans?"""
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 03:16:29 IST 2016,Forgive me. I posted on Reddit.
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:44:37 IST 2016,"@ckunzelman It catches me as very agenda driven, although I cannot speak to what that agenda is outside iconoclasm."
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:33:48 IST 2016,"Here's the thing: sometimes, gods deserve to be killed."
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:30:44 IST 2016,"@NEwertKrocker In Tactics, it's a system. Albeit, it takes years and years for that to happen. Durai Papers and all that."
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:29:41 IST 2016,"@NEwertKrocker And you're right. Context is key. Am I progressing and conquering, mechanically? Perhaps. But what is being supplanted?"
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:29:00 IST 2016,"@NEwertKrocker ""...which is a dictatorial application of player/actor power."""
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:28:09 IST 2016,"@NEwertKrocker Cool beans. The arguments I read basically implied ""Hey, the player is positioned as morally right to upend civilization.."""
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:25:50 IST 2016,@NEwertKrocker That's fair but how complicit is the player? Or Ramza?
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:21:27 IST 2016,"@Zython86 That's what I mean by ""the Planet does the pushback"". Holy saves the planet from the two greatest threats: Meteor and humanity."
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:20:43 IST 2016,The blame rest far more in the genre's form than a particular series. You could level these complaints against Ultima. And do so stronger.
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:18:42 IST 2016,"IV and V are the major exceptions to this, where the criticism might apply. Possibly XV, depending on the path it takes."
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:15:29 IST 2016,"But as a whole, to position FF as a series about fascism sort of characterizes the ways in which fascism functions and manifests?"
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:13:56 IST 2016,"IV does this. Cecil and Rosa end up ruling over Baron in TAY and Cecil is ""special"" as a Lunarian."
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:12:15 IST 2016,"A broader, grosser power narrative would not just deny old institutional powers but replace them with self serving ones."
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:11:13 IST 2016,And sure: X and LR play into the gotterdammerung angle. There's no denying that. But they impose no rules after God is dead.
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:08:31 IST 2016,"The particular exception is X, with Yuna and Tidus completing what Braska, Jecht, and Auron could not."
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:07:24 IST 2016,"The series has been going on for twenty years while, at least narratively, denying the power fantasy posited by the criticism."
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:06:18 IST 2016,"So, while early titles (particularly V) might fall into the fascist power narrative, this starts to ease off a lot once you hit 1997."
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:04:36 IST 2016,(Everyone should play Lightning Returns. It is absolutely scathing in its religious implications.)
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:03:35 IST 2016,"In fact, this thesis is so present in that series that in Lightning Returns, she literally kills god and then settles for a simple life."
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:02:39 IST 2016,XIII rests in a similar area. You may be fated to do something or divinely charged. The solution is to refuse the call.
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:01:21 IST 2016,XII focuses a lot on the ways in which people use power and posits that the good and dutiful thing is to relinquish and let go.
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 01:59:59 IST 2016,XII is explicitly about relinquishing seemingly divine granted power. That's Ashe's entire story arc and the core of the game.
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 01:59:11 IST 2016,Squall gets political power when he is chosen to command the Garden but he lacks the broader ambition to use it in any manifest form.
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 01:58:04 IST 2016,...that game is explicitly about how fucked up the people in jRPGs would actually be.
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 01:56:39 IST 2016,"In VIII, Squall might be fated, thanks to time travel shenanigans, to be the one who kills the Sorceress but..."
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 01:55:52 IST 2016,"As in, yeah, the heroes stop the bad guy. But Meteor still falls and the Planet does the pushback. Potentially by killing humanity."
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 01:54:53 IST 2016,"With VII, Cloud is a pretender who wields very little individual power. Beyond this, the original end implies the Planet saves itself."
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 01:53:53 IST 2016,"....I feel that VII, VII, XII and even XIII don't play into that. Let's go over why that might be the case."
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 01:53:02 IST 2016,"(Which, for the record, applies often to RPGs as a form. They're power politics are often very reductive and narrow minded.)"
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 01:51:23 IST 2016,"While I get the inherent idea: that RPGs position players as absolute authorities charged on mandate quests to ""better"" the world..."
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 01:50:48 IST 2016,I gotta take a nap but I've been thinking re: some thoughts I saw about Final Fantasy as fascist narratives.

transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 01:20:34 IST 2016,@Fengxii I know you're playing but my real answer is that food can be games. Which is *not* the same as games being good.

transgamerthink,Mon Feb 29 23:13:05 IST 2016,"@nath_kai @HurdyIV I was going to say something similar to this. It feels light, lacking a better word. Befitting the spectacular story."
transgamerthink,Mon Feb 29 22:47:45 IST 2016,I will chalk today up to hormones. Definitely all over the place. Hiccup in my extended transformation sequence.
transgamerthink,Mon Feb 29 21:52:44 IST 2016,@mandalaeyes going to get to stream now! Will list possible titles and pick a date soon!
transgamerthink,Mon Feb 29 20:34:34 IST 2016,"I've definitely felt more and more like this at my day job. I daydream and think about a ton of stuff that isn't ""here""."
transgamerthink,Mon Feb 29 20:33:49 IST 2016,"Continuing to feel ""off"" today with little explanation. Maybe I am just eager to work on more fulfilling ventures?"
