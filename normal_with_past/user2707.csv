RoloTony,Tue Mar 01 05:29:25 IST 2016,"Seriously, tho, if you are making eyes at a Yotes fan in your life, consider a gift from @OELofSweden maybe. Too great a concept to pass up!"
RoloTony,Tue Mar 01 05:25:07 IST 2016,"I love the way OEL plays-- he has a conservative-looking stride, but his movement is always purposeful and his skill can take over a game."

RoloTony,Tue Mar 01 05:16:58 IST 2016,"Also, apparently @OEL_23 has a lifestyle brand, @OELofSweden, which is awesome and hilarious."
RoloTony,Tue Mar 01 05:15:48 IST 2016,"I love to watch the chemistry that's developing between Domi and Duclair, and OEL is just an absolute legend. This'll be a great game!"
RoloTony,Tue Mar 01 05:14:34 IST 2016,"Since one of my best friends went to ASU and came back a huge Yotes fan, I've been watching them a lot this year. Fun team, for sure!"
RoloTony,Tue Mar 01 05:13:28 IST 2016,"When I was 6, 7 years old I was a huge Nikolai Khabibulin fan, and I LOVED the Yotes' jerseys."
RoloTony,Tue Mar 01 05:08:38 IST 2016,"I happen to quite like the @ArizonaCoyotes, even though I cheer for the Penguins. I owned a kachina jersey as a kid!"
RoloTony,Tue Mar 01 05:04:57 IST 2016,"I'm optimistic about the #Pens chances tonight against the Coyotes, but since one of my best friends is a Yotes fan I hope it's a close one!"

RoloTony,Tue Mar 01 05:01:22 IST 2016,I love all these boys! Let's hope they can put together a big win tonight! https://t.co/1OiXFpjzw5
RoloTony,Tue Mar 01 04:59:37 IST 2016,"Either way, I hope to see Dustin succeed at whatever level he plays at for the #Pens. Good guy, dece player, and well worth another shot!"
RoloTony,Tue Mar 01 04:58:17 IST 2016,"Dustin Jeffrey has been having a nice year in the AHL, and could be better in the NHL without the boat-anchors he played with in the past."
RoloTony,Tue Mar 01 04:54:18 IST 2016,"The #Pens also re-acquired Dustin Jeffrey, which I see as a low-risk move with a minimal chance of NHL playing time, barring injuries."
RoloTony,Tue Mar 01 04:50:30 IST 2016,There's a strong case to be made for keeping Zatkoff given that his trade value has been diminished and it was a buyer's market for goalies.
RoloTony,Tue Mar 01 04:44:02 IST 2016,"I think Murray will be the #Pens backup for the stretch run, but it's still smart to keep Zatkoff within the organization."
RoloTony,Tue Mar 01 04:42:16 IST 2016,I'm surprised that so many people on #Pens Twitter thought that a Zatkoff move was imminent based on Murray's call up.
RoloTony,Tue Mar 01 04:40:22 IST 2016,"I'm happy to see Sergei Plotnikov get out from under the #Pens forward depth chart, and wish him nothing but the best in AZ."
RoloTony,Tue Mar 01 04:39:25 IST 2016,"So, the trade deadline has come and gone, and there's been some changes to the look and feel of the #Pens, for sure."

RoloTony,Sun Feb 28 05:52:23 IST 2016,"@therealjz24 Not sure Cole's deal is an attractive addition to the Leafs roster when they are hemorrhaging big contracts, but it's possible."
RoloTony,Sun Feb 28 05:45:11 IST 2016,"@therealjz24 Quite possibly, but I'm not sure who the Pens could offer that'd clear cap space and still be attractive to the Leafs."
RoloTony,Sun Feb 28 05:42:18 IST 2016,I am intrigued by Jim Rutherford's comments that the #Pens may not be done dealing. Would love to see more speed added to the bottom-six...
RoloTony,Sun Feb 28 05:33:38 IST 2016,"Andrej Sekera, for example, was slow and mediocre in Carolina but played remarkably well after being traded to LA."
