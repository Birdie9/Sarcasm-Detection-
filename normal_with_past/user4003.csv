EZembeck,Fri Aug 30 05:30:43 IST 2013,@HollyAnderson no complaining about game length on opening night! :-) especially since this game may get close here.
EZembeck,Fri Aug 30 05:09:24 IST 2013,My 9 YO son displays fresh channel changing skills tonight 4 can...switching from halftime of one game to active one on his own. #proud
EZembeck,Fri Aug 30 04:21:32 IST 2013,Super fresh @ithacabeer Flower Power & college football. Cool weather too. Yes I am happy!

EZembeck,Tue Aug 27 05:57:39 IST 2013,@L_staff I'm afraid I'm going to have to revoke ur BA card. U always need to carry around appropriate glassware - just in case. @Sconscet
EZembeck,Tue Aug 27 05:11:23 IST 2013,Nice one - @smuttynosebeer Vunderbar Pilsner. Good to see in consumer-friendly 6 pack instead of the dreaded 4-pack last year.
EZembeck,Mon Aug 26 07:08:25 IST 2013,Having some @Gansettbeer Summer on tap & tastes great. #drinkingseasonal
EZembeck,Mon Aug 26 06:48:19 IST 2013,#NowDrinking @Widmer_Brothers Hopside Down IPL. Nice beer. More of these I drink the less impressed I get with Jack's Abby Hoponius.

EZembeck,Fri Aug 16 08:31:07 IST 2013,Drinking @UintaBrewing Hop Notch from the can. This beer is really growing on me...hoppy but with a strong malt backbone to balance it out.
