Zyros,Thu Sep 01 05:18:09 IST 2011,@cherryredcutie Unfortunately my original copy won't start up since the save data has randomly been corrupted. Hope you find ur charger tho!
Zyros,Thu Sep 01 05:15:49 IST 2011,@cherryredcutie Cool :) I&#39;m really looking forward to the GBA games since Zelda: The Minish Cap is supposed to be available.
Zyros,Wed Aug 31 20:42:57 IST 2011,Turns out I kinda suck at playing the original Super Mario Bros. Guess it has been a while since I played it though.
Zyros,Wed Aug 31 20:28:14 IST 2011,Nintendo 3DS free NES games are finally available from the eshop for those in the Ambassador program! http://t.co/Nhx7VWN
Zyros,Wed Aug 31 10:01:33 IST 2011,Just found out there is a new Blood anime called Blood C. Gotta check this out.
Zyros,Wed Aug 31 09:31:58 IST 2011,"Man, so this is what Shannen Doherty is up to these days: Doin&#39; college ads. Times be hard I spose. http://t.co/ptO3AqT"
Zyros,Wed Aug 31 07:20:38 IST 2011,"Just finished Bleach movie 4 & MAN WAS IT AWESOME!!! Wow, intense from the very start and even some emotional moments. Best one so far imho!"
Zyros,Wed Aug 31 02:02:13 IST 2011,"@obsidianoffing Yep, no problem I was surprised too. Streaming it now from animecrazy.net, although it&#39;s probably everywhere by now."
Zyros,Wed Aug 31 01:59:29 IST 2011,@obsidianoffing Not sure if you knew but looks like there&#39;s finally a sub out for Bleach movie 4 (Hell chapter) too.
Zyros,Tue Aug 30 05:35:13 IST 2011,@cherryredcutie I know you will be glad when you do! Hope you find something soon that&#39;s comfortable and affordable as well.
Zyros,Mon Aug 29 19:38:54 IST 2011,"In the mood to play Wind Waker. You know I never appreciated how beautiful this game is. The graphics still hold up very well, over TP even."
Zyros,Mon Aug 29 13:09:18 IST 2011,Dang that was some sweet music at the end of tonights True Blood. Pre-epic scene too.
Zyros,Sat Aug 27 16:11:57 IST 2011,"Just watched ""Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey."" Also found out that a 3rd movie is in the works. That should be interesting after so many years."
Zyros,Sat Aug 27 13:23:18 IST 2011,Also I&#39;m really loving the option to play stealthily like in Metal Gear or Splinter Cell.
Zyros,Sat Aug 27 13:21:49 IST 2011,Watching gameplay of Deus Ex: Human Revolution. This is a pretty sweet game. Surprised the first part of it takes place in 2027 Detroit.
Zyros,Thu Aug 25 14:26:23 IST 2011,"Just saw ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"" for the first time. Pretty fun film. Most excellent indeed."
Zyros,Thu Aug 25 10:11:08 IST 2011,"@cherryredcutie Haha, yeah, I suppose you won't be speaking in English too much anymore, but I do wonder if you'll lose the UK accent now."
Zyros,Thu Aug 25 10:07:40 IST 2011,"@cherryredcutie Ahh, that sucks that they dub them, but at least the voices don't seem to be too off."
Zyros,Thu Aug 25 05:18:56 IST 2011,"@cherryredcutie I doubt you'll forget your English, haha, I'll make sure you don't :)"
Zyros,Thu Aug 25 05:16:49 IST 2011,"@cherryredcutie If its in German, that's not so bad huh? Unless the English voices are dubbed over in German rather than having German subs."
Zyros,Thu Aug 25 05:15:07 IST 2011,"@cherryredcutie Yeah you really should, you will like it for sure. It really is the best movie of the year thus far in my opinion :)"
Zyros,Wed Aug 24 04:17:39 IST 2011,"And as for FD5, the 3D was actually a nice add and the plot was pretty interesting. Major twist at the end!"
Zyros,Wed Aug 24 04:16:26 IST 2011,For once I didn't glance at my watch and was disappointed when it ended. Planet of the Apes is by far the best movie I've seen all year.
Zyros,Wed Aug 24 04:14:34 IST 2011,"Just got back from Rise of the Planet of the Apes and Final Destination 5. Both were pretty good, especially the former."
Zyros,Tue Aug 23 19:25:57 IST 2011,"Not sure why I&#39;m up this early, haha, but awesome to see that the new Bleach is up early as well!"
Zyros,Mon Aug 22 20:00:55 IST 2011,Sucks now that some movies are MAKING you see them in 3D rather than giving you the standard 2D option. Hope this trend doesn't spread :(
Zyros,Mon Aug 22 19:59:39 IST 2011,"I wanna see Final Destination 5 tomorrow in theatres, but it's only playing in 3D which I really don't care for and rather watch in 2D."
Zyros,Mon Aug 22 19:20:17 IST 2011,"@cherryredcutie Dang, well the upside is that you won't have to deal with last night's cliffhanger and can watch them back to back :)"
Zyros,Mon Aug 22 15:49:20 IST 2011,"I'm glad [adultswim] is airing it otherwise I wouldn't have found out about it. Now it's back to the endless, but good, ""One Piece"" series."
Zyros,Mon Aug 22 15:47:50 IST 2011,"Just finished ""Durarara!!"" Started out a bit slow, but turned out to be a pretty good anime series."
Zyros,Mon Aug 22 13:09:09 IST 2011,HOLY CRAP that was some cliffhanger at the end of tonight&#39;s True Blood. Major craziness going down!
Zyros,Sat Aug 20 06:46:26 IST 2011,But I guess there is SH Downpour to look forward to though. Only I don't really want to buy a new console just to play it.
Zyros,Sat Aug 20 06:44:58 IST 2011,"I get they want to cash in on the MMO wagon and all, but imo it feels like a disservice to the fans. We didn't ask for this from SH games."
Zyros,Sat Aug 20 06:43:16 IST 2011,"Just saw the trailer for Silent Hill: Book of Memories for PS Vita. Tried to keep an open mind, but *sigh* This is NOT Silent Hill."
Zyros,Wed Aug 17 06:59:59 IST 2011,"@IcyBlue487 That was pretty lucky. I've watched some gameplay videos and it looks unique, not to mention the story seems interesting too."
Zyros,Wed Aug 17 01:06:04 IST 2011,It certainly is very easy to forget this is on a handheld. Just hope the controls are not frustrating since the 3DS has no 2nd analog stick.
Zyros,Wed Aug 17 01:04:44 IST 2011,The trailer and gameplay for Resident Evil: Revelations coming for 3DS next year really looks amazing! http://t.co/RimGAse
Zyros,Tue Aug 16 08:31:13 IST 2011,"Oh cool, next week Summer Glau guest stars on ""Alphas"" :)"
Zyros,Sun Aug 14 15:37:56 IST 2011,"45 floors of the hardest enemies and almost no health pick-ups. The reward isn't terribly great, but it feels pretty awesome to beat it :)"
Zyros,Sun Aug 14 15:35:41 IST 2011,Holy crap... did I really just beat the Cave of Ordeals in Zelda: TP on my first try?? Did NOT expect to get through it but wow am I glad.
Zyros,Sun Aug 14 05:17:36 IST 2011,"Wow, there is a killer storm happening outside right now. These clouds look amazing."
Zyros,Sat Aug 13 06:33:06 IST 2011,That was a really interesting and cool episode of Thundercats. I think this new iteration has alot of potential.
Zyros,Fri Aug 12 06:53:14 IST 2011,"YouTube is trying to be all Facebookey now with the new comments section, haha. I like it though."
Zyros,Thu Aug 11 20:20:40 IST 2011,"@obsidianoffing Lol, weird!"
Zyros,Wed Aug 10 13:55:03 IST 2011,Really wish this Kageroza dude in Bleach will just die already. This arc is going on a bit too long...
Zyros,Thu Aug 04 02:16:22 IST 2011,@obsidianoffing And I can't even sit my laptop on my lap without putting it on something since it gets way too hot.
Zyros,Thu Aug 04 02:15:02 IST 2011,"@obsidianoffing Those things are so cheap I swear. Gone through 1 already myself, but it was the metal pins inside that stopped connecting."
Zyros,Wed Aug 03 06:28:10 IST 2011,"@obsidianoffing Wow, didn't know she had a singing career. Makes sense though! I think her personality shines more in this than in TVD."
Zyros,Wed Aug 03 06:20:30 IST 2011,"Weird seeing Bonnie from Vampire Diaries rapping, lol. http://t.co/FOsBOtq"
