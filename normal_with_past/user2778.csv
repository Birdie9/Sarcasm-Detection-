downrightdpad,Mon Feb 29 21:26:56 IST 2016,"I mean, that stream is the equivalent of roughly FORTY EPISODES of a traditional series.  Dayum."
downrightdpad,Mon Feb 29 21:26:32 IST 2016,The video is going to stay in one piece for practical reasons (it'd be complicated as hell to figure out a good way to split it up)
downrightdpad,Mon Feb 29 21:26:10 IST 2016,Some folks were asking if we would put up the 10-hour #PokemonYellow stream in full or split it into pieces for easier consumption.
