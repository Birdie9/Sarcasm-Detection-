hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 04:23:00 IST 2016,@clexakissed it could be just because Clarke leaves polis
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 04:22:46 IST 2016,@clexakissed well we know that there's a good chance the sex scene isn't in that episode so it can't be too bad lol for how petty they are-
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 04:20:28 IST 2016,the day y'all can make a correct theory on t100 is the day I'll actually pay attention to the theories. weve NEVER been correct. don't panic
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 04:17:18 IST 2016,@thisisabbz positive reviews from pretty much everyone.
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 04:17:09 IST 2016,@thisisabbz they could like it for the simple fact that Clarke leaves polis. there's so many reasons they could like it. plus there's been -
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 04:13:21 IST 2016,but just bc they like the episode doesn't mean it's negative toward clexa
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 04:12:29 IST 2016,idk if anything I think it'll be a quick kiss that gets interrupted or a hug.
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 04:11:49 IST 2016,@Biii23 but clearly she will be back before the finale because THE scene definitely doesn't happen next ep. there's too much going on
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 04:11:25 IST 2016,@Biii23 idk. maybe bc they tend to use Kim to write the clexa episodes but I just don't see how that means she's back for 3x11 idk
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 04:05:48 IST 2016,same even if I know it's fake I'll cry my eyes out  https://t.co/A3XJvmfIs8
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 04:04:40 IST 2016,okay I know Lexa is going to be back for another episode before the finale but why is everyone so sure it's 3x11?
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 04:03:15 IST 2016,@runawayalycia and I think that's when Titus and Lexa talk and Lexa yells the separating feelings line
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 04:02:56 IST 2016,@runawayalycia this is what I think might happen tbh
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 04:01:24 IST 2016,I feel like Bellamy isn't going to snap out of whatever the fuck he thinks he's doing until he gets Lincoln killed for it

hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 03:42:51 IST 2016,@debnmheda don't kiss or hug at least we know that they will. it's frustrating waiting but w/e I think they will TBH
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 03:42:25 IST 2016,@debnmheda almost all the screeners love it even the ones that ship clexa to the death. so maybe it's just a good ass episode. even if they-
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 03:41:55 IST 2016,@debnmheda but they could love it because maybe clexa gets interrupted or bc of the Titus going crazy thing. who knows. but I've heard that-
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 03:40:48 IST 2016,@LifeIsBellarke y'all right bc he doesn't. and he doesn't have to overlook you guys even if it is platonic
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 03:40:24 IST 2016,@LifeIsBellarke well I won't defend him on that bc I know he does that. my initial thing was just about my comment. I'm not saying he treats
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 03:36:51 IST 2016,clock's grown immensely since the first episode of season one
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 03:35:26 IST 2016,I feel like there has to be at least a hug. Lexa won't let her leave without a hug. but I think it'll be a kiss https://t.co/FOPrlYUxYu
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 03:34:05 IST 2016,of course he did  https://t.co/htB78M61mQ
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 03:30:41 IST 2016,but that's something Jason would do. put it in to make it seem like it's them
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 03:30:22 IST 2016,I'm so worried that the handshake isn't clexa so I'm not getting my hopes up even though I feel like it is
