mjg59,Sun Feb 28 04:56:32 IST 2016,@kyriasis whereas changing CDDL to be GPL compatible would cover almost everything
mjg59,Sun Feb 28 04:55:42 IST 2016,"@kyriasis they could license their ZFS code, but several others would have to do the same for ZoL to be usable"
mjg59,Sun Feb 28 04:12:00 IST 2016,"@cryothresh Unless they explicitly say that you can only use 1.0, the CDDL says you can use any version. There are only two files that do."

mjg59,Sun Feb 28 02:49:39 IST 2016,@kittenpies3 There's a reasonable quantity of ZFS Linux code that isn't owned by Oracle
mjg59,Sun Feb 28 02:49:05 IST 2016,"There's about 200 lines of ZFS that are explicitly CDDL 1.0, but the rest would then be usable anywhere"
mjg59,Sun Feb 28 02:47:46 IST 2016,"CDLL allows the license steward to release new versions. Oracle could release a new, GPL-compatible version of CDDL if they wanted."
