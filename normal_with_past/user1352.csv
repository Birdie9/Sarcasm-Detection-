Teeeeejjj,Sun Feb 28 10:45:13 IST 2016,He beat you in the finals in five why are you praising him?  https://t.co/8yhLWO4bKO
Teeeeejjj,Sun Feb 28 10:44:32 IST 2016,@btd_7 I agree. But it's because of his insane shooting ability which makes everybody want to guard him which makes the rest wide open uk
Teeeeejjj,Sun Feb 28 10:40:59 IST 2016,"@btd_7 nah. Russ is a better defender, facilitator. I truly believe he's a better ALL AROUND taking EVERYTHING into account."
Teeeeejjj,Sun Feb 28 10:37:35 IST 2016,@btd_7 true but regardless I just think that stephs unbelievable shooting makes him seem like he's the goat but I just can't fw it
