TheDoctorJT,Sun Mar 20 23:03:14 IST 2016,The idea of no longer being a slave to the red-headed-bitch just hit me.  IT'S BEEN 8 AND A HALF YEARS

TheDoctorJT,Thu Mar 17 02:54:32 IST 2016,@YRTA does it literally give you no other details?
TheDoctorJT,Thu Mar 17 02:46:52 IST 2016,@Matthewthehill but that doesn't change the fact that I'm not sure how I'm supposed to feel about it.  But maybe that's the point.
TheDoctorJT,Thu Mar 17 02:46:36 IST 2016,@Matthewthehill No.  I actually just linked to a video of it.  It's.. uh.  honestly - it's not well done.  But it's also just a demo.

TheDoctorJT,Thu Mar 17 02:45:51 IST 2016,Or maybe a possible alternate ending where you die when you jump out of a window - I'm not sure.  Either way....what?
TheDoctorJT,Thu Mar 17 02:45:34 IST 2016,This... is literally a game that will always end the same.  You die when the tower collapses.
