Soulsilvatdope,Sat Feb 27 16:14:29 IST 2016,"My current list, probably obvious what they are.  Only really just started the run https://t.co/JMx88Qgnwh"
Soulsilvatdope,Sat Feb 27 16:05:48 IST 2016,@PushinUpRoses tells the truth but it seems to be anything cat related....
Soulsilvatdope,Sat Feb 27 16:04:05 IST 2016,@PushinUpRoses understandable tho for myself transfer it towards the Goodies
Soulsilvatdope,Sat Feb 27 16:03:01 IST 2016,"@PushinUpRoses aww man, it just seemed cooler that they were actual cats that somehow use Twitter.  Thanks for breaking the illusion T_T"
Soulsilvatdope,Sat Feb 27 16:01:45 IST 2016,So decided to do a Nuzlocke run with the 3ds version of pokemon red.  Should be fun or a tragedy.  Chose charmander 1st fyi
Soulsilvatdope,Fri Feb 26 16:07:55 IST 2016,I am Dad-Silver now.  Which means in pokemon terms I have spawn a little black/white :3

Soulsilvatdope,Sun Feb 21 07:42:04 IST 2016,*wait until full game reviews are released I should of said...
Soulsilvatdope,Sun Feb 21 07:38:04 IST 2016,@PushinUpRoses sounds almost as good as an actual chocolate pizza topped with marshmallows
Soulsilvatdope,Sun Feb 21 07:36:46 IST 2016,"And based off that beta/demo, unless you're keen on a new cover based shooter, I'd wait until the full game is released or it gets cheaper"
Soulsilvatdope,Sun Feb 21 07:31:31 IST 2016,"So""The Division"" beta...game feels a bit meh, had fun with Soulbro & his mate but the beta/demo seems too limited to give a good impression"

Soulsilvatdope,Sat Feb 20 10:29:13 IST 2016,o7 @Amdor6 and SniperWolf who killed each other when amdor panicked next to a car and caused it to blow up
Soulsilvatdope,Sat Feb 20 10:26:40 IST 2016,"So got the dopelives list for Xcom 2, so far @FlipKamiAtDope is a scientist and papa smurf is an engineer.  This run surely can't go wrong"

Soulsilvatdope,Thu Feb 18 20:38:03 IST 2016,As suggested by @MartyMcDevious my Xcom2 character is in the list if you want the most 100% accurate @dopefish_lives soldier list
Soulsilvatdope,Thu Feb 18 18:52:08 IST 2016,That cat ball.  JD is currently my bub-cat.  Turk is too but he likes to pretend he doesn't need as much affection https://t.co/H9Oipk7bZk

Soulsilvatdope,Thu Feb 18 15:06:04 IST 2016,Ah well either way something will work out.  Hopefully see you on stream sooner than later all
Soulsilvatdope,Thu Feb 18 15:04:16 IST 2016,"Speaking of new Xcom2 if any peeps have themselves in game I'd love to add them to my roster, same if others want myself in Xcom"
Soulsilvatdope,Thu Feb 18 15:02:14 IST 2016,I could do some Xcom2 but something tells me it may be overdone currently... unless peeps want to see the original Xcom2
Soulsilvatdope,Thu Feb 18 15:01:16 IST 2016,Theoretically it should mean at least a small increase in stream quality
