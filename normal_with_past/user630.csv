palmquac,Mon Feb 29 23:14:10 IST 2016,@HtownMadeMe Vegas set Portland's over-under for wins at 27.5. They beat that in 55 games.

palmquac,Mon Feb 29 22:55:35 IST 2016,@HtownMadeMe oh well. I'd rather no team want to play in my city and I could live there than live in a shitty town like Houston. Cheers!
palmquac,Mon Feb 29 22:54:42 IST 2016,"@HtownMadeMe out here in Portland? I'm inclined to disagree. Also 32-28 is hardly dog shit, and they're really fun to watch."
palmquac,Mon Feb 29 22:51:09 IST 2016,@HtownMadeMe & what we're arguing. Well you were disparaging Lillard's play in 1 game out of last 7 when he didn't hit 30. He's done alright
palmquac,Mon Feb 29 22:49:38 IST 2016,"@HtownMadeMe my team doesn't ""suck"" when you consider that they have the lowest payroll in the NBA. You're right though, your team sucks."

palmquac,Mon Feb 29 00:42:37 IST 2016,@twd3pdx he's worse than Trump. At least Trumpt tries to claim he didn't say stuff he said years ago. Piers does it during same match.
