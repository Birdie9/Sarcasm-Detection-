KimPitts,Sun Sep 01 05:29:55 IST 2013,The only good thing getting sick has done?  I've lost 5 pds and am now under my pre-Olivia weight!
KimPitts,Sun Sep 01 05:28:52 IST 2013,This whole sick and still getting over it thing sucks.  Also I need to go to Carter's before their Labor Day sale ends!
KimPitts,Sun Sep 01 02:35:00 IST 2013,@Ktoompas She's not 23!  And on the 3rd Baby Daddy who has already left!  With the other 2 not even on the birth certificates!  It's bad!

KimPitts,Mon Aug 19 23:03:02 IST 2013,@22Haylie WTF is this?!  Is this for real?  Who did it?!
KimPitts,Mon Aug 19 19:09:36 IST 2013,At least if Liv is going to wake up at 5 in the morning she is content to lay in bed and smile until she puts herself back to sleep!

KimPitts,Tue Aug 13 23:12:12 IST 2013,Aggressive people on Craigslist creep me out.  I'm just not a good Craigslister.
KimPitts,Tue Aug 13 08:04:14 IST 2013,No my SIX year old cannot see We Are The Millers.  Asking me twice doesn't change the answer or how inappropriate the movie is for him.
KimPitts,Tue Aug 13 04:37:56 IST 2013,@mama2twinsies I do a little of both.  Things I know he'll love and things he's requested.

KimPitts,Wed Jul 31 22:51:45 IST 2013,@MomMandyMusings I think once you get to a certain age you just don't want to spend the rest of your life alone.  :(
KimPitts,Wed Jul 31 05:45:55 IST 2013,Oh @lowes you really never fail to disappoint.
KimPitts,Mon Jul 29 18:50:21 IST 2013,"Liv woke up for an hour. Played, wiggled, and smiled in bed.  And now just put herself back to sleep.  Bc she loves me."
KimPitts,Mon Jul 29 11:09:53 IST 2013,@Ktoompas How long will you be there?  If we can get out of the house!  Everyone has been sleeping until after 10am lately!
KimPitts,Mon Jul 29 11:08:21 IST 2013,@Ktoompas LOL!  At least she's not making you look at ugly ones and telling you how awful they look?  Ha!
KimPitts,Mon Jul 29 10:59:38 IST 2013,@Ktoompas lol.  Nope.  I swear she is not usually this irritating but lately she really is driving me insane!

KimPitts,Sun Jul 28 04:17:55 IST 2013,Nothing like leaving a family party bc your SIX year old won't stop screaming.
KimPitts,Sun Jul 28 02:04:41 IST 2013,@MomMandyMusings I noticed that yours did that when I used Reader!  I'd have to refresh to make your post pop up!
KimPitts,Sun Jul 28 01:25:22 IST 2013,Running late.  Story of my life.
