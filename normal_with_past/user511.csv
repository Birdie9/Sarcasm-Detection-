DFS_BJ,Tue Mar 01 05:18:34 IST 2016,Final #Fanduel lineup for tonight's main slate. Shoutouts and RETWEETS are appreciated if we end up in the green! https://t.co/biJGz7z69K
DFS_BJ,Tue Mar 01 05:12:13 IST 2016,"Whole lot of late injury notes altered the #Fanduel lineup, will be posted at tipoff."
DFS_BJ,Tue Mar 01 05:01:03 IST 2016,@injericoswords thoughts on Markieff Morris drawing the start tonight?
DFS_BJ,Tue Mar 01 04:32:41 IST 2016,"If Rondo is out, collison figures to be a very wise play tonight."
DFS_BJ,Tue Mar 01 04:06:21 IST 2016,Looks good! Good luck! https://t.co/Z6z3PC6mSM
DFS_BJ,Tue Mar 01 03:53:13 IST 2016,"Big fan of the Westbrook / Cousins pairing, looks great! https://t.co/Mncv1b3id1"

DFS_BJ,Tue Mar 01 03:10:58 IST 2016,Randolph has a bigger role in the offense and plays a pretty bad DEN defense. #Grizzlies #NBA #Fanduel #Draftkings https://t.co/HjQH29w0wv
DFS_BJ,Tue Mar 01 03:10:00 IST 2016,@KingZito973 we're due for some dough man!!
DFS_BJ,Tue Mar 01 03:09:40 IST 2016,Feeling that the SAC/OKC game will turn into the most points for fantasy purposes. JR Smith is an enigma man https://t.co/uQMy69FSye
DFS_BJ,Tue Mar 01 03:07:50 IST 2016,@KingZito973 love the PG pairing!!

DFS_BJ,Tue Mar 01 02:32:41 IST 2016,Definitely. Should see a huge workload with Gallinari sidelined. Great play! #DFS https://t.co/nKsRxAdZ51

DFS_BJ,Tue Mar 01 01:36:33 IST 2016,@KingZito973 jokic is on our radar as well. Could be a great play
DFS_BJ,Tue Mar 01 00:30:45 IST 2016,@TheRealJIS I'm leaning well balanced with Westbrook or Cousins

DFS_BJ,Sun Feb 28 23:21:28 IST 2016,@TheRealJIS for GPP I'd say Lowry. Both can put up similar numbers but Lowry should be less owned
DFS_BJ,Sun Feb 28 23:18:11 IST 2016,@4eyezLokko here's what we've got as of now https://t.co/ZMCAhurZbJ
DFS_BJ,Sun Feb 28 23:07:03 IST 2016,@KingZito973 I think Otto Porter has the higher upside. Bazemore has been quite disappointing lately
DFS_BJ,Sun Feb 28 22:52:28 IST 2016,Hit us with your lineup questions for either the early or main slate today!
