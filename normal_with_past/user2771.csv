plumersplace,Tue Mar 01 05:28:48 IST 2016,Many people are interested in badging and would like to see it happen with both students and teachers. #badgechatk12
plumersplace,Tue Mar 01 05:24:42 IST 2016,"The more badging is used, the more teachers/students will want to use.  #badgechatk12"

Rocket park looks awesome"
plumersplace,Tue Mar 01 05:22:46 IST 2016,Maybe badges could be given to teachers as a type of reward.  Badges do not have to be for skills only.  #badgechatk12
plumersplace,Tue Mar 01 05:20:53 IST 2016,"Teachers receive badges for developing own badges in their content. Yes, there could be many badges for teachers.
#badgechatk12"
plumersplace,Tue Mar 01 05:16:33 IST 2016,Earning a badge for certain criteria/skills is more meaningful than receiving a grade. #badgechatk12
plumersplace,Tue Mar 01 05:14:47 IST 2016,"Skills depend on the class.  I have seen several badges in all contents
#badgechatk12"
plumersplace,Tue Mar 01 05:13:46 IST 2016,Developing badges is similar to making an assessment for a project. Students can share the badge where the assessment cannot. #badgechatk12
plumersplace,Tue Mar 01 05:11:02 IST 2016,"Once a teacher develops own badge, there is more of a buy-in.  Until you make one for students to earn, one may not like them. #badgechatk12"
plumersplace,Tue Mar 01 05:09:04 IST 2016,Criteria is known from the beginning so the students know what is expected to earn the badge.  Great way for an assessment. #badgechatk12
plumersplace,Tue Mar 01 05:07:03 IST 2016,"@SenorG We started badges in 5th grade, but teachers are developing badges in their classes. Students can share them instead of assessment."
plumersplace,Tue Mar 01 05:05:36 IST 2016,"Badges give the students a sense of responsibility/accountability.  Criteria must be met, no shortcuts,must be earned. #badgechatk12"
plumersplace,Tue Mar 01 05:03:15 IST 2016,"@katiejcain Hi Katie,
I am Ann Plumer.  I have experienced using badges in class and the students love them. #badgechatk12"
plumersplace,Tue Mar 01 05:00:59 IST 2016,@katiejcain I just happened to be on Twitter.  I am excited to participate.

plumersplace,Tue Mar 01 04:57:37 IST 2016,#mvms Twelve hours until we meet at the airport for the 8th grade trip to Washington.
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:28:10 IST 2016,#doslc?  THANK YOU so much to my FRIENDS for joining me tonight.  :)  Thank you!! Thank you!!
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:26:19 IST 2016,"@plumersplace @wusylkc I agree.  Even if  1st or 2nd graders, can brag about an accomplishment, it is a beginning."
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:24:51 IST 2016,RT @wusylkc: @plumersplace I agree! I think expectations for leading need to be different from grade to grade #doslc
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:24:06 IST 2016,"@plumersplace I think it is a good idea for children to share their work with parents, even if it is only one assignment."
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:22:48 IST 2016,"@plumersplace #doslc? Do SLC need to begin in elementary school?  If so, when? #doslc?"
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:19:00 IST 2016,"doslc? Do SLC's need to begin in elementary school?  If so, what grade?"
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:17:27 IST 2016,"@wusylkc Fifth graders thought they had to use the script word for word, whereas for 8th graders, it was more natural."
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:16:16 IST 2016,@wusylkc I think age has a lot to do with how the conferences were led.
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:15:37 IST 2016,"@AmyMWilkes I believe it was a great learning experience for students, teachers, and parents.  SLC's were much more positive."
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:14:19 IST 2016,"RT @wusylkc: @plumersplace Practice is necessary - for Ts and Ss. Ss were much more comfortable when they knew what to expect, share and saâ€¦"
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:14:08 IST 2016,@AmyMWilkes I agree that the practicing made the students more comfortable.
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:13:20 IST 2016,"@mariegraham I agree. The students used the script as a guideline when they practiced, but all was natural during their SLC."
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:12:05 IST 2016,@katiejcain Looks like some good looking students.  :)
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:11:37 IST 2016,@plumersplace A4 Students do need to be prepared and go over material before sharing just as teachers need to prepare for their classes.
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:10:05 IST 2016,"#doslc?  Do SLC's require practice
before the day of the conference?"
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:07:50 IST 2016,@mrsacbragg  :)  :)
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:07:32 IST 2016,@mrsacbragg THANK YOU SO MUCH for coming.  :)  You are a true friend.
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:06:21 IST 2016,@mrsacbragg @AmyMWilkes Another question will be coming soon.  :)
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:05:34 IST 2016,@mrsacbragg @AmyMWilkes I am sorry for the parents which could not come.  They missed out on an opportunity.
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:04:48 IST 2016,RT @mrsacbragg: @plumersplace @AmyMWilkes yes! Agreed #doslc
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:04:28 IST 2016,@AmyMWilkes  This is fun!
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:04:11 IST 2016,RT @AmyMWilkes: @plumersplace I saw so many Ss amazed at how much they have learned and accomplished. It was rewarding #doslc
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:04:00 IST 2016,"@mrsacbragg @AmyMWilkes Yes, they want what is best for their child, but maybe the discussion should be with the student's teacher in Subj"
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:02:44 IST 2016,@plumersplace I wish my children had had this opportunity.
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:01:46 IST 2016,"@mrsacbragg @AmyMWilkes  I agree, but I think the younger grades were not as concerned. grades brought up because of going to 9th grade."
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:00:32 IST 2016,RT @mariegraham: @scitechyEDU @plumersplace These went so well!!! :)
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:00:19 IST 2016,"@plumersplace A3 Definitely, the SLC's were about sharing, the first time many parents were even aware of what their child was doing."
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 04:58:25 IST 2016,"@AmyMWilkes As a whole, I think the SLC's were refreshing for all: students, teachers, parents.  Grade issues can be later by class teacher."
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 04:56:25 IST 2016,@wusylkc I do think some of the portfolios needed to have more of an explanation.
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 04:55:06 IST 2016,@AmyMWilkes A2 Several parents were totally surprised at how well their child did in leading the conference. Tears in eyes.
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 04:55:05 IST 2016,#doslc? Do SLC's focus more on students' grades or sharing portfolios?
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 04:54:20 IST 2016,@AmyMWilkes A2 Several parents said they heard their child talk more the day of conferences than they had for months.
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 04:53:30 IST 2016,"@mrsacbragg Definitely!! Today, students are involved in numerous activities. After being in school all day,  activities, not much home time"
