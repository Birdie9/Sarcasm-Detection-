JonnyRussell100,Sat Aug 31 17:56:44 IST 2013,Good luck today G's - you're all legends - lets deliver our safety!!!!!
JonnyRussell100,Sat Aug 24 23:28:53 IST 2013,"@dieseuntjie sadly no difference between 133 all out and 166-9 in terms of points, but would boost morale to hold on!"
JonnyRussell100,Sat Aug 24 21:34:03 IST 2013,@dieseuntjie thanks! Keep those updates coming. Come on G's bat us to safety - you can do this!!

JonnyRussell100,Sat Aug 24 01:12:46 IST 2013,@phine82 @DuncMills you were definitely swaying a lot !!!
JonnyRussell100,Fri Aug 23 23:29:43 IST 2013,@Aggerscricket today is the biggest sign yet that we have reached the peak and are on the slide down. Australia will win the next 3 Ashes
JonnyRussell100,Fri Aug 23 23:14:49 IST 2013,5 out of the last 6 overs have been maidens - this is truly pitiful. Making me support the Aussies
JonnyRussell100,Fri Aug 23 22:43:57 IST 2013,@DuncMills @phine82 I doubt you were as bad as Pete as Celtic - never seen a man leave his body behind as much as that!
JonnyRussell100,Fri Aug 23 22:16:32 IST 2013,@DuncMills hence his sheepish celebration of 50! Second slowest ever! Luckily good company and first drink for 23 days has entertained me!
JonnyRussell100,Fri Aug 23 21:46:51 IST 2013,@KJABartonSchlee I don't enjoy a team taking the foot off gas with a clueless selection and negative cricket - great teams destroy the weak
JonnyRussell100,Fri Aug 23 21:40:53 IST 2013,"If anyone can find a day when Australia of the 90's / windies of the 80's scored 200 runs in reply to 500, then I will stand corrected"
JonnyRussell100,Fri Aug 23 21:38:40 IST 2013,"Aus have bowled well, but our dour, negative approach has been disgusting. At times you have to tough it out but not today #embarassment"
JonnyRussell100,Fri Aug 23 21:37:05 IST 2013,England's performance today has been an embarrassment and is proof that we will get well beaten in Oz and they will reclaim the Ashes
JonnyRussell100,Fri Aug 23 21:25:25 IST 2013,England are so useless that the scoreboards have been broken for the last half an hour and it hasn't made a difference #needtodominate
JonnyRussell100,Fri Aug 23 19:14:00 IST 2013,@A1F1E9 watch out for the water on the 4th hole! I chipped into it twice in a row on Wednesday. Reckon you should play Goring & Streatley
JonnyRussell100,Sun Aug 18 16:03:28 IST 2013,On the +ve have kept wicket 5 times for the 1st XI and conceded 9 byes in total. On the -ve have 4 ducks out of 4 innings vs shinhole

JonnyRussell100,Sat Aug 17 22:35:20 IST 2013,We're back on! 6 overs lost
JonnyRussell100,Sat Aug 17 22:29:25 IST 2013,@dieseuntjie you've got a good standard to keep up next few weeks - only 1 bye and no drops from me today :)
JonnyRussell100,Fri Aug 16 12:45:59 IST 2013,@tom_huelin world class player but won't be able to stop the slide from the treatment table
JonnyRussell100,Fri Aug 16 12:44:33 IST 2013,@offsidemaestro so good to have you back on twitter. It was actually mistype last season - there was a 1 missing before the 9
JonnyRussell100,Fri Aug 16 04:48:00 IST 2013,"Genuinely think Man United will finish outside top 4 this year. Expect Arsenal, Spurs and maybe even Liverpool and Swansea to finish higher"
JonnyRussell100,Thu Aug 15 23:47:14 IST 2013,David Moyes is talking nonsense - everyone knows the fixtures are random (subject to certain conditions) - is he losing the plot already?
