PhoinixArt,Tue Mar 01 05:29:34 IST 2016,"Normally, our democracy has several layers of ""safety"" built into its gov that make a military refusal to follow orders totally unneeded."
PhoinixArt,Tue Mar 01 05:27:54 IST 2016,It is such a danger to democracy that it's hard to see a safe way forward after that point. Very much US version of crossing the Rubicon.
PhoinixArt,Tue Mar 01 05:26:06 IST 2016,"That conflict is understood to mean that ""illegal order"" equals something very very big & worth the risk to democracy to disobey."
PhoinixArt,Tue Mar 01 05:24:26 IST 2016,"So there's a conflict in training/socialization- you don't follow illegal orders, but also the civilians are in charge."
PhoinixArt,Tue Mar 01 05:23:03 IST 2016,"The military, deciding on its own, what orders are not legal- even if it's done rightly the first time sets a dangerous precedent."
PhoinixArt,Tue Mar 01 05:21:42 IST 2016,"The military hasn't done that so far, b/c of the knowledge that it'd likely open a door that couldn't be closed again."
PhoinixArt,Tue Mar 01 05:20:45 IST 2016,"This is something pretty strongly drilled into you - you don't follow illegal orders.

Even so, it'd be v/troubling. https://t.co/yiFj1mxqLK"

PhoinixArt,Tue Mar 01 00:06:45 IST 2016,@_michaelbrooks I'd be careful about the drone program esp in Pakistan. A lot of that seems at the request of at least elements of their gov
