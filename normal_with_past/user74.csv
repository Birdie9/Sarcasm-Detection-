hpyrancher,Mon Mar 21 17:09:29 IST 2016,@nobamanoway In New York Trump loses to Clinton by 17 and Sanders by 19. Over 60% of Americans don't like Trump.
hpyrancher,Mon Mar 21 17:00:40 IST 2016,@nanaziegler You mean the same voting machines that were used to give Trump big wins in primaries?
hpyrancher,Mon Mar 21 16:54:39 IST 2016,Forget about Trump's path to the GOP nomination. He trails Clinton in Utah and in New York by double digits. Trump can't win in November.

hpyrancher,Mon Mar 21 09:09:36 IST 2016,@CheriJacobus @LatinaforTed  Will someone please ask Trump whether he believes in shape shifting reptilians like his buddies Alex and Roger?
hpyrancher,Mon Mar 21 09:04:07 IST 2016,@loudobbsnews Are you a shape shifting reptilian too? So much for credibility. Maybe you and Roger Stone can get a show on Infowars.
