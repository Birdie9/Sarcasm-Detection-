dfg77,Mon Feb 29 12:15:56 IST 2016,@benpobjie @awelder @robcorr I think he’s got his figures backwards. ie. 2/3 neg gearing claimants earn under $80k
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 12:13:41 IST 2016,@awelder @robcorr @pat_gardner given median income in Australia is under $50k I don’t think his 2/3 figure makes sense.
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 12:05:49 IST 2016,@robcorr probably just incompetent.
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 12:03:49 IST 2016,@mumbletwits he seems to be doing that quite a bit since his elevation.
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 11:58:49 IST 2016,@mumbletwits that seems very unlikely.
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 09:53:00 IST 2016,"@jurassic_snark_ @TheMrFish yes, because the debt is tied to the asset."
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 09:50:40 IST 2016,"@jurassic_snark_ @TheMrFish yes, but usually your house has appreciated in value. That covers the loan. If prices drop, neg equity occurs"
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 09:49:35 IST 2016,@egadheg @jurassic_snark_ and owner occupiers were getting 95% loans up until recently.
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 09:47:28 IST 2016,"@jurassic_snark_ yes, but not everyone will have equity equal to their debt if there’s a price crash."
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 09:43:22 IST 2016,"@jurassic_snark_ no, because no one will pay 900k for your house. You owe the bank every cent."
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 09:39:53 IST 2016,"@jurassic_snark_ because you still owe 900k, even if your next house is a tent. And you have to pay the whole mortgage out when you sell."
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 09:33:35 IST 2016,@jurassic_snark_ exactly. And if you sell you need to pay that to discharge the mortgage.
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 09:32:15 IST 2016,"@jurassic_snark_ if I borrow 900k to buy a 1M house, then the price drops to 800k I have negative equity."
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 09:28:18 IST 2016,@jurassic_snark_ not if you owe more than the house you’re selling is worth. That’s negative equity.
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 09:26:45 IST 2016,"@jurassic_snark_ yes, but if you owe $20,000 more than your house is worth it doesn’t matter how cheap the next one is. You’re stuck."
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 09:15:37 IST 2016,@jurassic_snark_ if you owe more than the house is worth you have to find the extra money to pay out the loan when you sell. So no one sells
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 09:05:31 IST 2016,"@jurassic_snark_ negative equity would bring the entire market to a screaming halt, no one could sell."

dfg77,Mon Feb 29 01:40:04 IST 2016,@purserj I got a bindi in my foot once. It can be calamitous.

dfg77,Mon Feb 22 01:57:31 IST 2016,@John_Hanna wonder if it’d be much different here?
