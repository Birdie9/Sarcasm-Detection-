zacksonnenberg,Thu Feb 25 00:21:32 IST 2016,"Sincerely, a pissed off Uber driver."
zacksonnenberg,Thu Feb 25 00:21:17 IST 2016,"Again, this is about what's fair. The way how Uber is treating their drivers is not just unfair, it seems borderline illegal."
zacksonnenberg,Thu Feb 25 00:20:42 IST 2016,And tip your drivers. You are a stranger in somebody's car. It costs on average $0.54/mile for us to drive our own cars between everything.
zacksonnenberg,Thu Feb 25 00:19:38 IST 2016,"If Uber *MATCHES* what we were making this time 16 months ago, then we'll talk about me opening the door for someone."
zacksonnenberg,Thu Feb 25 00:18:57 IST 2016,And after almost 1300 rides in the last year and a half I got a strike for not opening the door for somebody.
zacksonnenberg,Thu Feb 25 00:18:22 IST 2016,"Oh and as a driver, if you let a ride go no matter how far away it is, it affects your acceptance rate, even if the pickup point is 30 min."
zacksonnenberg,Thu Feb 25 00:17:35 IST 2016,So take a look at those screenshots of the rides I'm talking about and tell me they're not red. Red = Surge. Plain and simple.

zacksonnenberg,Thu Feb 25 00:04:17 IST 2016,I might be partially colorblind but that is fucking red. It couldn't get more red than that. I don't take photos of ride arrivals for fun.
zacksonnenberg,Thu Feb 25 00:01:57 IST 2016,"Between my tweets yesterday and emailing back-and-forth, Uber is trying to convince me that these were in fact not surge rides."
zacksonnenberg,Thu Feb 25 00:01:03 IST 2016,Recently I had 2 rides in the Glendale area that were clearly in red zones (addresses altered for privacy). Look... https://t.co/3n4S1hOmyq
zacksonnenberg,Wed Feb 24 23:58:32 IST 2016,"Drivers thrive on being in areas that show up as red on a map that indicate a higher (or ""Surge"") rate, especially these days."
zacksonnenberg,Wed Feb 24 23:57:31 IST 2016,"Usually I wouldn't make this big of a deal over something like this, but since the fares are now $0.80/mile & $0.15/min average, it's enough"
zacksonnenberg,Wed Feb 24 23:54:36 IST 2016,I'm glad there are drivers out there that do drive late at night because we need them... I just fear for my safety and condition of my car.
