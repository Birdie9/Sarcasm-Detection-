Absurd13t,Tue Mar 01 05:29:51 IST 2016,@TingleIn I worked in a shop too. For 5 weeks. It helped me despise people a bit more so it was worth it.
Absurd13t,Tue Mar 01 05:28:54 IST 2016,@HamillHimself I saw it. It wasn't very good. #sorry #dontusethejedimindtrickonme
Absurd13t,Tue Mar 01 05:28:06 IST 2016,@TingleIn but she is a mainstay on the Smooth FM playlist as my neighbour keeps demonstrating through the wall.

Absurd13t,Tue Mar 01 01:26:44 IST 2016,@AitchTeaDrinker actually not. Catholics think it actually becomes it. Others that its merely symbolic.

Absurd13t,Mon Feb 29 21:40:34 IST 2016,@bambula @inrng I agree but acting as if there is some magic bullet which makes the bad guy go away is disingenuous. Accidents will happen.
Absurd13t,Mon Feb 29 21:36:20 IST 2016,@bambula @inrng I'd like to see people who write letters to the UCI coming up with their own ideas. Theres relatively little you can do.
Absurd13t,Mon Feb 29 21:33:49 IST 2016,@inrng @bambula I would tend to think that constant horn blowing would get zoned out after time and become part of the background.

Absurd13t,Mon Feb 29 21:08:05 IST 2016,@djtimkai Shout it loud. I'm dubious and proud!
Absurd13t,Mon Feb 29 20:41:06 IST 2016,@braintree_ @Mark_Collyer I avoid flights because it physically hurts my ears even if I sit there swallowing like a champ.

Absurd13t,Mon Feb 29 15:38:40 IST 2016,This is 1 hour and 46 minutes of abstract ambient noise. Its what it would feel like to be adrift. Try it. https://t.co/T13cjqgHHA
Absurd13t,Mon Feb 29 07:07:36 IST 2016,@Brumcast @sklawlor Yes. I've even been to the place since I used to live in Germany in that general area.
Absurd13t,Mon Feb 29 07:03:00 IST 2016,@Brumcast @sklawlor The first few albums from 71-72 before they start making tunes are influential for me. Its noise but without showing off
Absurd13t,Mon Feb 29 06:57:01 IST 2016,@Brumcast @sklawlor depends how you define. Listen to the early 70s acts like Cluster and its noise. Granted its not a guy shouting in a mic
Absurd13t,Mon Feb 29 06:50:35 IST 2016,This collection of unlistenable noise is my new album. Annoy yourself until you can't stand it anymore at https://t.co/T13cjqgHHA

Absurd13t,Mon Feb 29 06:31:51 IST 2016,@MikeDJeremy you're probably right
Absurd13t,Mon Feb 29 06:30:31 IST 2016,@MikeDJeremy I never got any higher!
Absurd13t,Mon Feb 29 06:29:49 IST 2016,@LestweetsF1 I rather make album after album that NO ONE likes. That's my kind of challenge.
Absurd13t,Mon Feb 29 06:29:03 IST 2016,@MikeDJeremy I've done my share of toilet cleaning and floor mopping thanks.
Absurd13t,Mon Feb 29 06:25:43 IST 2016,"@LestweetsF1 musicians ask ""Do I like this?"" and that seems very strange and egotistical. Who would think they are arbiters of validity?"
Absurd13t,Mon Feb 29 06:19:54 IST 2016,"The point of making music is to like it - both you and others, right?

NO."
