Greg_YNWA1,Tue Mar 01 04:53:57 IST 2016,"@David_Solo_Dolo Please dont even get me started, Im just barely beginning to calm down over than insanity yesterday."
Greg_YNWA1,Tue Mar 01 04:45:39 IST 2016,"Yeah ""captain."" Glad you were ready to be 6th in a 5-shot penalty shootout. #Leadership https://t.co/h9MijK3T0P"
Greg_YNWA1,Tue Mar 01 04:15:20 IST 2016,"If penalty shootout went to 8th, 9th rounds.....would #LFC ""captain"" and Sturridge have taken the kick before Kolo and Mignolet?!"
Greg_YNWA1,Tue Mar 01 04:12:29 IST 2016,"In other news, it has been revealed that 2+2=4 https://t.co/ZKXjglS1gp"
Greg_YNWA1,Tue Mar 01 03:52:18 IST 2016,#LFC penalty lineup Sunday truly one of the most outrageous things I have seen in years w/ this club. Indefensible! https://t.co/JAvMeIWEBQ

Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 23:46:25 IST 2016,"At work so not online much. Did #LFC ""captain"" step up yet to lead his team wanting a penalty in a shootout w/ trophy on the line?"
Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 23:32:06 IST 2016,@JPens4Real21 Wow! That is huge. Good luck. Very exciting.
Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 17:28:19 IST 2016,@Mu_94_ @AzzurriLFC I can't take it. Seriously cannot take reading that compliment of Hendo. 7am on a Monday morning and this ruined my day!
Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 17:27:24 IST 2016,@WuTangYaNan @SonOfDonkeyKong Remember it perfectly. Mario ignored him and took it without being asked
Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 16:57:21 IST 2016,"Guess I wasn't dreaming. It really did happen that #LFC ""captain"" ""leader"" (and decent penalty taker) didn't want a PK in shootout. Reality"
Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 16:27:20 IST 2016,"Just woke up. Was I just dreaming, or did #LFC ""captain"" (and one of teams best 3 penalty takers) not want a PK in shootout for a trophy?"
Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 05:45:48 IST 2016,"Thanks @DC_LFC for great event today. Heartbreaking result, but thrilling day -- great food/drink, gifts from @AnfieldShop, food drive. üëèüëè"
Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 02:10:07 IST 2016,"Enjoy your blind defense of #LFC penalty lineup and the leadership of our ""captain"" not being part of the five.

I'm out.

#YNWA"
Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 02:06:54 IST 2016,"It's happening far too slowly...
But those confident Hendo is a ""worthy #LFC captain"" are falling as silent as the Rodgers-In crowd did."
Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 02:04:55 IST 2016,@Mr_ITellYah For sure. But you know Im one who has critiicized both from day one.  And today for Hendo......this is it!!
Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 02:03:42 IST 2016,"Hendo-lovers....If #LFC got a penalty during the match, surely Milner takes it. Who would you imagine would have been 2nd option? Be honest!"
Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 01:52:48 IST 2016,"Crushed.
Most want to defend Milner and #LFC ""captain"" not taking penalties. Cool. You were probably the same ones saying ""Rodgers-In""."
Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 01:45:43 IST 2016,@ONEKEPLER like I said I hope Milner makes his 5th kick and would love to know why/how #LFC captain is cool not being part of he five at all
Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 01:42:49 IST 2016,"@ONEKEPLER 1) ""captain"" not demanding to be part of shootout is unreal 2) let me know how Milner's ""5th kick"" goes."
Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 01:40:57 IST 2016,"@Pounds_Sterling penalties are 50-50? So Hendo, Milner, Sturridge are watching Lallana, Lucas take penalties. Insanity!!!"
Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 01:39:46 IST 2016,"@Pounds_Sterling Man, summer rebuilding is true regardless of today's result. Focus is on today."
Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 01:39:01 IST 2016,"Hendo-lovers....please explain to me how #LFC ""captain"" was OK without even being in 5-man penalty rotation with a trophy on the line."
Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 01:37:11 IST 2016,"Cool. 
1) Let me know if he made it. 
2) ""Captain"" not even in penalty lineup at all?! https://t.co/mbbr3PL72p"
Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 01:36:12 IST 2016,"Trophy on the line, up 1-0 after one round of PKs, and #LFC ""captain"" and ""vice-captain"" never take a kick. 

BULLSHIT!!!!!!!!!!!"
Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 01:34:34 IST 2016,@Pounds_Sterling Explain to me why our captain and vice captain weren't part of this luck-process?
Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 01:33:07 IST 2016,"Trophy on the line and Milner, Sturridge, and #LFC ""captain"" are watching Can, Lucas, Lallana take penalties. OK. BULLSHIT!!!!!"
Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 01:30:19 IST 2016,"Surely the #LFC captain would demand a PK in a shootout w/ trophy on the line. How did your kick go, ""captain""? https://t.co/ihLBQ2wTrG"
Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 01:03:59 IST 2016,"RT @TheSplinterCell: I have to say...

What happened to #LFC captain and vice captain on the penalties?....

#CapitalOneCupFinal"
Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 01:03:52 IST 2016,"RT @TheSplinterCell: I'm absolutely LIVID with Henderson and Milner. I've not seen such cowardice in a long time in football.

#CapitalOneC‚Ä¶"
Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 01:03:17 IST 2016,"For those defending the insane #LFC penalty lineup by saying ""Milner was going 5th"". Let me know if he made it."
Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 00:59:46 IST 2016,@jeffanikin cool. Lemme know if he makes it.
Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 00:57:36 IST 2016,Don't give me any crap about PKs being luck etc and answer my damn question why Lucas/Lallana take penalties over Milner????????????????
Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 00:55:57 IST 2016,"Can anyone deny if #LFC got a penalty during match that Milner would take it?????

Yet in shootout he doesn't and Lucas/Lallana do? BULLSHIT"
Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 00:49:17 IST 2016,"If #LFC were awarded a penalty in the game, who would have taken it???????

But in a shootout Milner is watching Lucas and Lallana take PKs?"
Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 00:46:48 IST 2016,So Milner....with one strength he brings to #LFC doesn't take a PK?  OK b
Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 00:34:51 IST 2016,Minutes from jubilation or heartbreak.
Greg_YNWA1,Mon Feb 29 00:25:08 IST 2016,Absolutely unbelievable drama at Wembley.

Greg_YNWA1,Sun Feb 28 23:59:21 IST 2016,Absolute madness at #LFC bar!! Going crazy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Greg_YNWA1,Sun Feb 28 23:40:52 IST 2016,Cmon MLS teams. Make an offer for Milner.
Greg_YNWA1,Sun Feb 28 23:40:06 IST 2016,If Origi is the sub at 80'....what changed in 10 minutes that he wasn't subbed in at 70'????????????
Greg_YNWA1,Sun Feb 28 23:35:38 IST 2016,I can't believe Origi isn't on.
Greg_YNWA1,Sun Feb 28 23:28:03 IST 2016,"Jurgen, #LFC approaching 20 mins left needed a goal ....GET ORIGI IN THE GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Greg_YNWA1,Sun Feb 28 23:25:42 IST 2016,"Origi for Hendo.
Doubt it will ever happen. Will continue to cater to #LFC ""captain"""
Greg_YNWA1,Sun Feb 28 23:24:28 IST 2016,Right now? https://t.co/QfJ7fbL0uK
Greg_YNWA1,Sun Feb 28 23:22:15 IST 2016,"Get Origi on, Jurgen."
Greg_YNWA1,Sun Feb 28 23:20:22 IST 2016,Remember that moment if #LFC equalIze. Sterling missed easy chance to get his trophy.
Greg_YNWA1,Sun Feb 28 23:19:14 IST 2016,@Mr_ITellYah Trust me I'm his biggest critic. Brutal to watch all season.
