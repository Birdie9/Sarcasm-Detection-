Rhellion,Tue Mar 01 02:20:15 IST 2016,Can someone DM me story spoilers from Balance of Power???
Rhellion,Tue Mar 01 02:11:25 IST 2016,"@thelazypainter @lecuyerjake @LuckySixes at this one, yes. It was very much a narrative event. Others usually no."
Rhellion,Tue Mar 01 02:00:06 IST 2016,"@ginger_buddha @the_black_sun @markthebeastman same here actually, I just mocked it up! Especially dependent on Pestilence battletome."

Rhellion,Tue Mar 01 01:46:44 IST 2016,"@lecuyerjake and the answer is no, they didn't"
Rhellion,Tue Mar 01 01:46:20 IST 2016,"@lecuyerjake well there were lots of chaos armies painted ALL different colors. what if their defense is ""all of the colors is my scheme""?"
Rhellion,Tue Mar 01 01:22:04 IST 2016,@ginger_buddha @Aceldamor you can't
Rhellion,Tue Mar 01 01:20:17 IST 2016,"@Aceldamor @ginger_buddha and it wasn't a big deal at all / game altering so I'm not salty, just want to clarify for the future."
Rhellion,Tue Mar 01 01:19:33 IST 2016,@Aceldamor @ginger_buddha not sure exactly on the event wording. It didn't really register that it happened til after or I'd have asked lol.
Rhellion,Tue Mar 01 01:04:58 IST 2016,"@ginger_buddha there was no rule against it, just maybe should be addressed in the future (which is why I bring it up)"
Rhellion,Tue Mar 01 01:03:41 IST 2016,Thoughts on club mates running between tables to let each other borrow models to summon? Happened to me at Holy Wars but didn't make a fuss.
Rhellion,Tue Mar 01 00:00:18 IST 2016,"@Rhellion never mind, reread and now clear."
Rhellion,Mon Feb 29 23:58:54 IST 2016,South Coast GT... does your summoning pool have to also come out of your 150? Or when you reduce your army 10 can you nominate any 20?
Rhellion,Mon Feb 29 23:21:33 IST 2016,@AndrewNiekamp @MicroHammer lol @PointHammered ?
