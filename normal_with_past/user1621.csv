DamnBirdshit,Tue Mar 01 05:29:42 IST 2016,Maybe Trevor Timmins isn't that great of a scout. Maybe THAT'S why no players can graduate to the NHL. #Habs
DamnBirdshit,Tue Mar 01 04:06:39 IST 2016,@HeyMyNameIsWill good point Will. #ThisFrontOffice
DamnBirdshit,Tue Mar 01 04:05:49 IST 2016,I'm considering shutting myself down for the remainder of the regular season. #ThisFrontOffice
DamnBirdshit,Tue Mar 01 04:04:06 IST 2016,Bergevin traded for Matteau bc he was interested in him in his draft year. 4 years ago. He has enough of a resume to know we don't need him.
DamnBirdshit,Mon Feb 29 07:38:27 IST 2016,"@HabsLaughs it is actually a fun romp, considering how dour the last 3 Bonds were with Craig."

DamnBirdshit,Mon Feb 29 06:47:35 IST 2016,I like the Oscars. It tells me which movies I'm supposed to download illegally.

DamnBirdshit,Mon Feb 29 06:36:22 IST 2016,How tall is Kevin Hart? Seriously.
DamnBirdshit,Mon Feb 29 06:33:35 IST 2016,@FO_ScottKacsmar it's beautifully shot. I loved it despite the fact that I knew exactly where it was going.

DamnBirdshit,Sun Feb 28 06:12:09 IST 2016,@wabby10556 hahaha it stings. How are you? I'm working with C. Hughes now at RC.
DamnBirdshit,Sun Feb 28 06:05:42 IST 2016,@goalpostcam I heard that too. What a dope
DamnBirdshit,Sun Feb 28 06:04:35 IST 2016,Why is the 11-14-67 line so crummy? This 2nd line with 42-81-27 is exciting and responsible. I don't get this team....

DamnBirdshit,Sat Feb 27 19:13:12 IST 2016,"@unclebizzy4 not this Habs fan. Adios, Dale!"
DamnBirdshit,Sat Feb 27 18:55:00 IST 2016,@unclebizzy4 I'm bothered that MB traded for a guy that he drafted in CHI. He has players he drafted here that can't play for this coach.
DamnBirdshit,Sat Feb 27 18:53:43 IST 2016,@unclebizzy4 @Snakebite350 I think you're missing the point. I don't care for Weise. Teams wanted him. Deal to a Hawks rival. Better pick.
DamnBirdshit,Sat Feb 27 18:51:28 IST 2016,@unclebizzy4 @Snakebite350 a 2nd in 2018 from a team that will dominate is basically a 3rd in a weak draft.
DamnBirdshit,Sat Feb 27 18:50:30 IST 2016,@Miss_Fenton098 I want this on my tombstone
DamnBirdshit,Sat Feb 27 18:49:46 IST 2016,"@Miss_Fenton098 my thoughts are this - if you're happy with your phone, hold on until something better that you want rolls out."
DamnBirdshit,Sat Feb 27 18:48:15 IST 2016,@Miss_Fenton098 ridiculous oversight
DamnBirdshit,Sat Feb 27 18:48:05 IST 2016,@Miss_Fenton098 Samsung has to make a patch to combine the native/expandable storage on S7s. I just read that Forbes piece.
DamnBirdshit,Sat Feb 27 18:46:57 IST 2016,"@JessHabs you can be a Hawks fan. It's OK. I'd like to watch them burn, personally"
DamnBirdshit,Sat Feb 27 18:46:06 IST 2016,"@Miss_Fenton098 S5s are $0 now too, right?"
DamnBirdshit,Sat Feb 27 18:42:04 IST 2016,@JessHabs you are tho
DamnBirdshit,Sat Feb 27 18:41:19 IST 2016,@Miss_Fenton098 gotta agree with this. Wish my Nexus had an SD slot
DamnBirdshit,Sat Feb 27 18:38:23 IST 2016,@Snakebite350 pretty lame return. Should have dealt to a Blackhawks rival with better picks IMO
DamnBirdshit,Sat Feb 27 16:27:38 IST 2016,@HappyCaraT I want the Blackhawks to turn back into a 1998 pumpkin.
