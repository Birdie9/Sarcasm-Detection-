Chuck_Lief,Mon Feb 29 19:25:24 IST 2016,@steverosenbloom this is news?
Chuck_Lief,Mon Feb 29 19:00:57 IST 2016,@fredonair once you eat Smoque BBQ you'll never go back.
Chuck_Lief,Sun Feb 28 08:40:47 IST 2016,@ctsbulls 100 more points given up to an opponent. Hoiberg ever going to stress defense?
Chuck_Lief,Sun Feb 28 08:24:16 IST 2016,@vgoodwill rolled and stepped on.  Ouch.
Chuck_Lief,Sun Feb 28 07:51:03 IST 2016,@_stutzy_ @chicagobulls and good basketball teams.
Chuck_Lief,Sun Feb 28 07:47:49 IST 2016,@SherwoodStrauss what does Enes Kanter do for a living?
Chuck_Lief,Sun Feb 28 07:34:48 IST 2016,@russbengtson did Durant just pass to Foye when he had Steph guarding him?  Why????
Chuck_Lief,Sun Feb 28 07:30:28 IST 2016,"@NickFriedell don't look now.  Another 30 point quartet for the opponent.  Great defense, solid effort."
Chuck_Lief,Sun Feb 28 07:29:06 IST 2016,@Schumouse he doesn't belong on a NBA roster.  Such a mental midget.
Chuck_Lief,Sun Feb 28 07:26:51 IST 2016,@vgoodwill I'm talking about tonight...
Chuck_Lief,Sun Feb 28 07:25:24 IST 2016,"@vgoodwill he's taking horrible contested shots too.  Not very intelligent,"
Chuck_Lief,Sun Feb 28 07:21:18 IST 2016,@vgoodwill dreadful.
Chuck_Lief,Sun Feb 28 07:20:48 IST 2016,@Schumouse I think an errant Bulls three pointer just hit my bedroom window.
Chuck_Lief,Sun Feb 28 07:16:27 IST 2016,@vgoodwill they're unwatchable
Chuck_Lief,Sun Feb 28 06:28:56 IST 2016,@Howsito @iamvega1982 are we still expected to believe the bullshit coming from Rose and the Bulls that this is precautionary?
Chuck_Lief,Sun Feb 28 04:30:31 IST 2016,@Ralphie505 I'm watching and laughing.  Massive coaching failure.
Chuck_Lief,Sat Feb 27 08:08:06 IST 2016,@NickFriedell it was only a matter of time.  A Good team was going to steamroll this crap roster.
Chuck_Lief,Sat Feb 27 07:13:06 IST 2016,@NickFriedell this my friends is BULLS basketball.
Chuck_Lief,Thu Feb 25 18:52:20 IST 2016,@fredonair that's a lot of yoga mat.
Chuck_Lief,Thu Feb 25 08:32:51 IST 2016,@NickFriedell time for Hoiberg to coach.  I don't think he's capable or coaching them to a win.
Chuck_Lief,Thu Feb 25 08:31:54 IST 2016,"@ctsbulls Hoiberg needs to sit Brooks.  If not, he's asking to lose."
Chuck_Lief,Thu Feb 25 08:31:27 IST 2016,@Schumouse saw this coming from a mile alway.  Brooks can't be in this game.  Total liability.
Chuck_Lief,Thu Feb 25 08:05:28 IST 2016,@Schumouse so this is the Bulls version of the death lineup.
Chuck_Lief,Thu Feb 25 06:01:56 IST 2016,@chrisbleck that's exactly what I'm saying.
Chuck_Lief,Thu Feb 25 05:51:54 IST 2016,@BigChris_70 it's annoying that they're playing for their playoff lives and he's sitting out as a precaution.  Washington is chasing them.
Chuck_Lief,Thu Feb 25 05:49:12 IST 2016,@TeamStradley not watching.
Chuck_Lief,Thu Feb 25 05:48:49 IST 2016,@BigChris_70 bad choice of words.  It's annoying.
Chuck_Lief,Thu Feb 25 05:47:46 IST 2016,@NickFriedell this team is fighting for a playoff spot right?  So sick of this shit.
Chuck_Lief,Thu Feb 25 05:47:11 IST 2016,@NickFriedell unreal.
Chuck_Lief,Wed Feb 24 05:30:06 IST 2016,"@ctsbulls plus, they're apparently all in and have an OF need.  He was the best OF left."
Chuck_Lief,Wed Feb 24 05:29:40 IST 2016,@ctsbulls not relatively speaking.  For what Fowler provides 10mm per year isn't that expensive.
Chuck_Lief,Wed Feb 24 05:25:40 IST 2016,@ctsbulls massive fail by Rick Hahn.
Chuck_Lief,Wed Feb 24 05:12:03 IST 2016,Way to go @NotRickHahn  https://t.co/nM4RGOwQiz
Chuck_Lief,Wed Feb 24 02:57:47 IST 2016,@NWSChicago @Metra is Metra retweeting because the snow is going to create massive delays?  Typical...

Chuck_Lief,Mon Feb 22 08:42:27 IST 2016,@vgoodwill they're used to it.  Bulls would lose to one NBAs worst after beating the 2nd best team in the east.  Zero mental toughness.
Chuck_Lief,Mon Feb 22 08:20:28 IST 2016,@HerringWSJ that Syracuse salary on top of Rookie money.  Not bad.
Chuck_Lief,Mon Feb 22 08:12:55 IST 2016,@ctsbulls Bulls have to nut up defensively.  Just give some effort.  These guys don't even want to defend.  It's pathetic.

Chuck_Lief,Mon Feb 22 07:41:52 IST 2016,"@Schumouse when Butler returns, there's no reason for Snell's ass to not be plastered at the end of the bench.  None."
Chuck_Lief,Mon Feb 22 07:41:12 IST 2016,@WaddleandSilvy even when the Bulls have leads I get pissed off.  58 first half point to the Lakers!?!?!
Chuck_Lief,Mon Feb 22 07:38:38 IST 2016,@Jason1Goff the Bulls help defense is __________
Chuck_Lief,Mon Feb 22 07:24:08 IST 2016,@vgoodwill this Bulls defense is worse than I thought.  On pace to give up 110+ to these Lakers.
