anduruna,Mon Feb 29 10:26:38 IST 2016,AWW YES HE WON
anduruna,Mon Feb 29 09:48:37 IST 2016,@wiisp I USED TO DO THIS. One time I had a snot explosion and was too embarrassed to sneeze normal again.
anduruna,Mon Feb 29 04:36:05 IST 2016,"@wiisp All racists claim they aren't racist, sadly. Sorry to see you lose someone to Trump-ism. Two of my dear friends are, too."
anduruna,Sun Feb 28 20:14:29 IST 2016,And I remain honestly confused as to why other Dems seem to like Clinton so much. I always thought she was a mediocre moderate at best.
anduruna,Sun Feb 28 20:11:00 IST 2016,"The problem with ""pushing a candidate left/right"" is that it only lasts until they're elected. Then they immediately revert when in office."
anduruna,Fri Feb 26 12:57:51 IST 2016,@literallyrova Executive order: Finish it. Do it while the same artist is available and its still fresh in their mind.
anduruna,Tue Feb 23 02:58:45 IST 2016,Increasing number of loved ones declare support for Trump. Can't understand. Not sure how to react. Frustrating and disappointing.
anduruna,Fri Feb 19 05:17:00 IST 2016,"@finryan87 That fucking Water Temple just ruins everything. Shadow Temple was pretty dull, too. Fire wasn't totally awful. DRAGON."
anduruna,Wed Feb 17 21:05:54 IST 2016,Important but unsurprising to learn: Grandma's favorite modern singer is apparently Lady Gaga.
anduruna,Fri Feb 12 21:41:49 IST 2016,"@finryan87 WITHOUT THE MAGIC BARRIER REPULSING THE FORCES OF DOOM, THE ENTIRE REALM WILL FALL"
anduruna,Fri Feb 12 21:41:12 IST 2016,@finryan87 But the gendered bathroom door currently acts as a magical portal that somehow prevents attackers from entering!
anduruna,Tue Feb 09 03:45:45 IST 2016,@meganlavengood YES.
anduruna,Thu Feb 04 06:41:48 IST 2016,Similar to how there's a big difference on the right between neoconservatives and libertarians.
anduruna,Thu Feb 04 06:41:06 IST 2016,"They're in two different ideological branches of the left wing. Hillary is a center-left moderate, and Bernie's a democratic socialist."
anduruna,Thu Feb 04 06:40:02 IST 2016,"Hillary and Bernie fighting over the term progressive is silly, because it's a meaningless blanket term applied to most everyone on the left"
anduruna,Wed Feb 03 11:34:07 IST 2016,@finryan87 Do it. It's worth it.
anduruna,Wed Feb 03 03:32:26 IST 2016,@wiisp Just because she's a woman doesn't mean she's a good candidate. I hate feeling like voting for Hillary is obligatory for feminists.
anduruna,Wed Feb 03 03:31:02 IST 2016,"@wiisp Yeah, those same progressive women weren't too impressed that Sarah Palin nearly became our first female VP. Fair game to mock her."

anduruna,Sat Jan 30 23:48:26 IST 2016,Expanded thoughts on the ending: https://t.co/Pu37pdTbCD
anduruna,Sat Jan 30 21:45:35 IST 2016,You learned about it through the entire trilogy. Were warned about it. It would've tested how much players paid attention. But alas.
anduruna,Sat Jan 30 21:43:56 IST 2016,I still really wish that the Mass Effect writers would've fully embraced the indoctrination concept. Would've been an amazing theme.
anduruna,Fri Jan 29 00:44:18 IST 2016,"The older I get, the more irritated I become with the concept of property values."
anduruna,Sun Jan 24 01:21:02 IST 2016,hrrrrrAAAAAGHHHHHHH >:(
anduruna,Fri Jan 22 19:36:21 IST 2016,"Nearest urgent care is twenty minutes away, and I'm too scared to ask mom if I can borrow the car or, god forbid, have her take me."
anduruna,Fri Jan 22 19:26:18 IST 2016,Submitted job application last night. Woke up this morning with strep throat. Perfect. More icing on the shit-cake this week.
anduruna,Wed Jan 20 00:31:09 IST 2016,"Adrienne started playing Fallout for the first time. Understandably, she stayed up until about 6 in the morning, just as I was waking up!"
anduruna,Fri Jan 15 21:04:44 IST 2016,"@TheBriness All the rhetoric in the ""war on political correctness"" has morphed into ""being an asshole is the opposite of being PC."""
anduruna,Fri Jan 15 21:03:30 IST 2016,@TheBriness Because considering the views and experiences of other people means things aren't like THE GOOD OL DAYS.
anduruna,Wed Jan 13 08:51:06 IST 2016,"Spent the day at the hospital because grandma had an ""episode"" with her heart. Scary, but she's doing okay now. #DeathisScaredofHer"
anduruna,Fri Jan 08 23:23:52 IST 2016,"@finryan87 Thanks. I was pretty upset this morning, especially because I was the one who technically messed up, but I'm doing better now."
anduruna,Fri Jan 08 23:23:08 IST 2016,"If it weren't for Adrienne, I'd be in pretty bad shape right about now. But she comforts me and looks after me and I looooove her."
anduruna,Fri Jan 08 23:20:00 IST 2016,"It is tasking and draining to be someone's punching bag on a regular basis. I admittedly make mistakes sometimes, but... yeah."
anduruna,Fri Jan 08 07:22:33 IST 2016,@anduruna The game was intensely stressful from beginning to end (in a good way). Just like the first movie.
anduruna,Fri Jan 08 07:16:53 IST 2016,Finished Alien: Isolation and oh my god it was fantastic.
anduruna,Mon Jan 04 04:21:50 IST 2016,Didn't know they were holding an Asshole Convention in Oregon this weekend.

anduruna,Fri Dec 25 20:29:04 IST 2015,"As per tradition, I am sick on Christmas. Pretty much passed out when wrapping presents last night, had to have Adrienne take over. :("
anduruna,Wed Dec 23 10:04:11 IST 2015,The fact that UPS/Fedex can't deliver to PO Boxes and the local USPS can't deliver to street addresses is illogical and unhelpful.
anduruna,Wed Dec 23 10:02:10 IST 2015,"Online store: ""We can't accept PO Box addresses."" Halfway through shipment: ""Transferred package to USPS, pick up at post office box."""
anduruna,Wed Dec 23 01:49:45 IST 2015,"Annnnnd now my mother thinks I am the enemy and hurled insults at me. Well, Merry Christmas. Buying rum for myself."
anduruna,Tue Dec 22 07:33:26 IST 2015,"Basically, any problems with TFA are tiny compared with the huge, glaring problems of the prequels. TFA is a ""normal"" Star Wars film."
anduruna,Tue Dec 22 07:32:44 IST 2015,"Guardians of the Galaxy, for example? Technically no character growth at all, but an incredibly fun and entertaining film."
anduruna,Tue Dec 22 07:32:11 IST 2015,"Critics of the plot are technically right, but all the original films were broken too. You can still like broken things."
anduruna,Tue Dec 22 07:21:03 IST 2015,STAR WARS WAS GREAT
anduruna,Mon Dec 21 06:53:33 IST 2015,STAR WARS TOMORROW MORNING OH BOY
anduruna,Wed Dec 16 09:23:17 IST 2015,"I am very surprised by the number of Mass Effect voice actors in Fallout 4, and it feels weird whenever I hear them."
