dipship31,Sun Sep 01 05:29:49 IST 2013,@ricosuavetb it just sucks that we pretty much need the defense to score those 5 points though. A TO feels like our only chance #BYUvsUVA
dipship31,Sun Sep 01 05:14:34 IST 2013,WTF this play calling #BYUvsUVA
dipship31,Sun Sep 01 05:11:38 IST 2013,@bethany_camille not as tough for those who are actually watching #BYUvsUVA
dipship31,Sun Sep 01 05:10:24 IST 2013,@jarobusa it's week 1. Throwing the ball is too risky #BYUvsUVA #anaelogic

dipship31,Sun Sep 01 05:04:08 IST 2013,Looks like for the 3rd year in a row we can just feel sorry for the defense doing everything right.... And get no help #BYUvsUVA

dipship31,Sun Sep 01 04:17:21 IST 2013,#BYUvsUVA any lead for our defense feels so safe

dipship31,Fri Jun 28 02:31:20 IST 2013,@sluhm in a weak draft he's well worth the risk at #14 in my opinion
dipship31,Fri Jun 28 02:10:19 IST 2013,@sluhm @cronair and we would love to see it on our phones!
dipship31,Wed Jun 19 09:50:54 IST 2013,@not_TYCORBIN I get trying to push the ball and catch them off guard.... BUT NOT WITH PARKER ON THE BENCH!! Should've called TO

dipship31,Tue Apr 09 08:15:28 IST 2013,@bballSource Fitting since they've barely made a decision on anything so far

dipship31,Sat Apr 06 00:31:45 IST 2013,@Lockedonsports How do you make 30+ straight free throws earlier in the year to this???
dipship31,Thu Apr 04 09:07:30 IST 2013,There was no correct answer in the Eureka poll. J5 was the correct answer: Play Bad Teams #denatuta
