markbarrington,Tue Mar 01 05:29:32 IST 2016,After 10 days in Seoul my twitter trends were in Hangul. Back in the US for a week and now 50% back to English.
markbarrington,Tue Mar 01 05:25:09 IST 2016,RT @MATTatACA: #TiVo-Greater emphasis on MVPD partnerships & less on retail https://t.co/fF1kq5zyJq MP-Still support #AllVid? Hmm. https://‚Ä¶
markbarrington,Fri Feb 26 02:06:11 IST 2016,@OneJaredNewman no extra box needs IP multicast to scale. No cable company has that at scale yet. Satellite will never have it (obv).
markbarrington,Fri Feb 26 02:00:20 IST 2016,Public Knowledge acknowledges #unlockthebox still needs another box leased from the cable company https://t.co/7jYzAO1SuZ
markbarrington,Wed Feb 24 07:40:08 IST 2016,ICYMI ‚ÄúWhy the FCC won‚Äôt unlock the box‚Äù https://t.co/gFDJfx3JBE #unlockthebox
markbarrington,Tue Feb 23 06:35:15 IST 2016,I just published ‚ÄúWhy the FCC won‚Äôt unlock the box‚Äù https://t.co/pOWGYppECq What Steve Jobs said about why retail set-top boxes won't work.
markbarrington,Tue Feb 23 01:53:37 IST 2016,One reason why the FCCs #unlockthebox proposal needs a new box. Live unicast video over IP doesn't scale. Yet. https://t.co/A0vCUynP5I
markbarrington,Mon Feb 22 16:07:57 IST 2016,@fairmilewest @iannock 30 extra euros? Was it down the back of the sofa?
markbarrington,Sat Feb 20 08:01:32 IST 2016,@benthompson but it does raise the question of how they changed the AppleId password. Presumably you need to know the old one to change it?
markbarrington,Sat Feb 20 07:39:34 IST 2016,@benthompson Does it matter who changed it? Even if FBI f'd up that doesn't change the need to get into the phone.
markbarrington,Wed Feb 17 15:16:47 IST 2016,@BenedictEvans I guess we're joining Apple in doubling down on a position. I do agree that words are important in this context.
markbarrington,Wed Feb 17 15:12:12 IST 2016,@BenedictEvans in the context of data on your phone there is little practical difference. Security is the mechanism that provides privacy.
markbarrington,Wed Feb 17 15:01:20 IST 2016,@BenedictEvans and it seems like a legitimate concern of the state to examine known terrorists data to expose their methods and networks.
markbarrington,Wed Feb 17 14:59:44 IST 2016,@BenedictEvans it's security against your data being exposed by bad actors. Sounds like a privacy concern to me.
markbarrington,Wed Feb 17 14:41:53 IST 2016,@BenedictEvans so Tim Cook *can* help the FBI investigate terrorist networks but he *won't*. Because privacy.
markbarrington,Wed Feb 17 10:41:05 IST 2016,@mobileperret so jet lagged I'm replying twice to the same thing.
markbarrington,Wed Feb 17 10:39:26 IST 2016,@mobileperret and it's fun to think about sitting in a Seoul conference room......
markbarrington,Wed Feb 17 10:02:03 IST 2016,"@mobileperret no, there will be mistakes. And I want transparency. But it feels like total privacy allows bad folks to thrive."
markbarrington,Wed Feb 17 08:18:30 IST 2016,@mobileperret definitely a difficult balance. Police can smash down your door with a warrant. Absolute privacy might not be the right goal.
markbarrington,Wed Feb 17 08:05:58 IST 2016,"@mobileperret its tough though, right? I want the FBI, with proper warrants etc, to get the contents of the San Bernardino shooters iPhone."
markbarrington,Wed Feb 17 02:15:48 IST 2016,"@iPolicy yes, the sunshine period must have come as a real surprise to them üòØ"
markbarrington,Wed Feb 17 00:38:54 IST 2016,@eric_analytics I reread their filing and their concern is additional regulatory mandate. Either for Allvid or making OVDs MVPDs.
markbarrington,Wed Feb 17 00:30:44 IST 2016,RT @FCCTech: Free spectrum for Googley purposes.  The best things in life are free.  https://t.co/TGq5yxKqD6
markbarrington,Wed Feb 17 00:26:51 IST 2016,Murdoch is an investor in Roku. That might be relevant here. https://t.co/AoXg3DjOZZ
markbarrington,Wed Feb 17 00:21:03 IST 2016,TV over fiber retreats to good old linear broadcast. All about the economics. https://t.co/i42bn0E1DG
markbarrington,Wed Feb 17 00:11:04 IST 2016,"@davezatz @HalSinger @MATTatACA right, like the TWC trial in NY that provides service to a ""free"" Roku. No cable box required."
markbarrington,Wed Feb 17 00:08:48 IST 2016,@davezatz @HalSinger @MATTatACA The STELA act last year removed the need for Cable to integrate Cablecard. Still have to provide to others.
markbarrington,Tue Feb 16 17:53:16 IST 2016,@davezatz @HalSinger @MATTatACA but I can't wait to lease the FCC solution at the promise 20c per month (10% of '94 prices per Wheeler)
markbarrington,Tue Feb 16 17:51:11 IST 2016,"@davezatz @HalSinger @MATTatACA however much those costs come down could be matched by the MVPD with the same solution, theoretically."
markbarrington,Fri Feb 12 03:27:01 IST 2016,@pizarrowrites Can I get the reverse book first? How to use those concepts to tell great stories with charts.
markbarrington,Mon Feb 08 20:27:37 IST 2016,@MarcusSpecSoln @FCC also pay tv is very technically diverse. Hard to build a single standard that works for all cases.
markbarrington,Mon Feb 08 20:26:06 IST 2016,@MarcusSpecSoln @FCC cablecard showed that consumers aren't that interested and retail devices like Tivo aren't cheaper.
markbarrington,Fri Feb 05 01:51:00 IST 2016,"@SwanniOnTV exactly. operators have a set of levers to influence video sub rates. Promotions, disconnect policy, credit rating on sign up..."
markbarrington,Fri Feb 05 01:34:16 IST 2016,@awolk these tiny swings up and down basically talk to a roughly flat market. What's overblown is the commentary on either side.
markbarrington,Wed Feb 03 22:49:05 IST 2016,@DavidMercer_SA @TheRogueAnalyst @YouTube like 3D bulky glasses are a killer.
markbarrington,Tue Feb 02 23:39:04 IST 2016,@coreanalysis Netflix bitrate ladder was 1mb/s for 640x480. 1.75mb/s for  720x480. They are changing that to a per title ladder.
markbarrington,Tue Feb 02 23:28:49 IST 2016,@coreanalysis right. Throttle the delivery rate to be the max 480p Netflix rate. That can be a static agreement.
markbarrington,Tue Feb 02 22:38:25 IST 2016,@coreanalysis @TMobile Netflx does not deliver the manifest unencrypted. BingeOn can't be modifying it. Can they?
markbarrington,Tue Feb 02 02:25:23 IST 2016,@frwrdnet @BenedictEvans A cell-phone is more complex but can be connected to multiple operators. In principle it should be doable.
markbarrington,Tue Feb 02 02:24:27 IST 2016,@inventur_es @BenedictEvans Tablo TV have this for free-to-air content. Adding multi-operator encryption and network support is harder.
markbarrington,Tue Feb 02 02:23:14 IST 2016,"@fmbutt @BenedictEvans Software plus a network interface, plus a hardware root of trust, control mechanism etc."
markbarrington,Tue Feb 02 02:17:57 IST 2016,"@BenedictEvans The timeframe for either is long. More than 10 years. I would bet on open STB being first, Congress willing."
markbarrington,Sun Jan 31 01:19:05 IST 2016,@awolk Google has had the Google Fiber box for some while. Perhaps their aim is to be able to connect that to other cable networks.
markbarrington,Thu Jan 28 08:50:29 IST 2016,"RT @benthompson: Ah, that's why Google posted about beating 'Go' now even though they're not playing the world champion until March https:/‚Ä¶"
markbarrington,Thu Jan 28 00:04:09 IST 2016,@davezatz President Trump will say this is a huuuuge mistake.
markbarrington,Mon Jan 25 02:13:39 IST 2016,@BenedictEvans Shelf = efficient way to find what I know I want. Table = Help me find something to read.

markbarrington,Sat Jan 23 15:49:01 IST 2016,@glovelace @Snapchat you need somebody under 21 to explain it to you.
