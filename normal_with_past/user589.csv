StreetDreamer83,Mon Feb 29 04:48:27 IST 2016,I like how nobody cared about the t-shirts until they heard free tickets to the race in Vegas. #WinterShowdown

StreetDreamer83,Mon Feb 29 03:31:27 IST 2016,I'll give today's #NASCAR race a 9/10.
StreetDreamer83,Mon Feb 29 02:41:56 IST 2016,@IHeartSeanLeahy You're going to regret not going sooner after you finally see it.

StreetDreamer83,Mon Feb 29 01:08:56 IST 2016,@bobpockrass Or maybe his crew chief should do his job and let his driver know about the penalty.
StreetDreamer83,Mon Feb 29 01:02:30 IST 2016,"@bobpockrass How long would #NASCAR allow someone to stay out and ""not be scored""?"
StreetDreamer83,Mon Feb 29 01:00:36 IST 2016,@bobpockrass Shouldn't he be several more laps down seeing as he stayed out after #NASCAR supposedly stopped scoring them?
StreetDreamer83,Sun Feb 28 10:21:22 IST 2016,Funny thing is the fans at the track knew. The boos told the story.
StreetDreamer83,Sun Feb 28 10:17:53 IST 2016,Nothing worse than a guy who can't admit that they flat out got beat.
StreetDreamer83,Sun Feb 28 10:14:27 IST 2016,"Wow, what a cry baby."

StreetDreamer83,Sun Feb 28 08:16:57 IST 2016,Too bad none of the North State guys are running this race. Would be nice to see how they would have done.
StreetDreamer83,Sun Feb 28 08:12:38 IST 2016,This guy calling the Lucas Mod race kind of sounds like Greg Gumbel.

StreetDreamer83,Thu Feb 25 05:31:30 IST 2016,Evernham is mythologized for his career with Gordon yet Shelmerdine NEVER gets credit for his career with Earnhardt.
StreetDreamer83,Thu Feb 25 05:21:57 IST 2016,Ricky Rudd is a #NASCAR HoF candidate but Kirk Shelmerdine isn't. Can't say I'm surprised.
