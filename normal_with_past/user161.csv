JeffreyBridges,Fri Mar 18 04:20:10 IST 2016,"@ChrisTheBarton Oh! Rise's graphics are also excellent, and the cutscene animation is like feature cgi animation studio stuff. it's amazing."

JeffreyBridges,Thu Mar 17 23:15:03 IST 2016,@bryanedwardhill I'm honestly not sure why. X-Men were huge to me in my teen years. It's odd.

JeffreyBridges,Wed Mar 16 19:49:30 IST 2016,@rycady Yeah! like... fifteen or more years ago. I REMEMBER NOTHING. Maybe that's intentional...
JeffreyBridges,Wed Mar 16 08:43:45 IST 2016,@GeoffThorne Ha. I'm mostly just riffing on a concept @susanlbridges and I made into a script. It's a topic of interest over here.
JeffreyBridges,Wed Mar 16 08:39:47 IST 2016,@GeoffThorne I dunno about talented. There's an awful lot of crazy coincidences in the plot. Stuff no one in their right mind would... well.
