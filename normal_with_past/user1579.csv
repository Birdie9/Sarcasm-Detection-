callum90ish,Tue Mar 01 05:23:18 IST 2016,@GabeAul @thingiverse Spoiler alert: this is what I used for my replica! It was my idea to publish it for Insiders to play with.
callum90ish,Tue Mar 01 04:44:40 IST 2016,"@NorthFaceHiker @GabeAul @brandonleblanc I just need to get a push-button off Amazon, and I'll have a duplicate of the build button!"

callum90ish,Tue Mar 01 03:23:22 IST 2016,@bdsams @maryjofoley @GabeAul Would you like a photo of my official DIY Red Button when I finish it?
callum90ish,Tue Mar 01 03:09:33 IST 2016,"@bdsams @maryjofoley @GabeAul He hates preview builds, but as I said, it's a tempting-looking button."
callum90ish,Tue Mar 01 03:09:05 IST 2016,@bdsams @maryjofoley @GabeAul Which means that my 10-year old brother constantly feels an irrestible urge to push it.
callum90ish,Tue Mar 01 03:07:08 IST 2016,"@bdsams @maryjofoley @GabeAul It's for my little brothers birthday. It's big, red, shiny and sorta looks like candy..."
callum90ish,Tue Mar 01 03:03:20 IST 2016,I'm 3D printing a replica of the red button right now. Thanks @GabeAul for the files! #WindowsInsiders #Windows10 #Windows10Mobile
callum90ish,Tue Mar 01 03:02:09 IST 2016,@bdsams @maryjofoley @GabeAul I'm 3D printing a replica of the button as we speak. Thanks Gabe for the .stl files!

callum90ish,Fri Feb 26 06:01:25 IST 2016,"@Jacek164 If every build contains approx. 300 changes, then that's a lot of improvement in 365 days of OS development."
callum90ish,Fri Feb 26 06:00:47 IST 2016,"@Jacek164 It won't take 50 years. They launch preview builds every 1-2 weeks, and CB builds every 3-6 months."

callum90ish,Fri Feb 26 05:58:19 IST 2016,"@Jacek164 Actually, I believe engineers check Windows Feedback for new complaints and ideas frequently. Right, @NorthFaceHiker?"

callum90ish,Fri Feb 26 05:53:32 IST 2016,@Jacek164 @NorthFaceHiker I have a suggestion for you. Try submitting the problems you find (in a calm manner) using Windows Feedback.
callum90ish,Fri Feb 26 05:53:06 IST 2016,@Jacek164 @NorthFaceHiker Isn't Windows 10 a free upgrade? I know plenty of people using and loving #Windows10. Definitely works 4 me.

callum90ish,Fri Feb 26 01:56:32 IST 2016,"@windowsinsider @NorthFaceHiker @brandonleblanc @VMware I'd try it out again, but I really dislike frequent, random crashes."
