BCLee33,Mon Aug 29 23:19:11 IST 2011,@PatKessler Do those Senators want that kind of endorsement?

BCLee33,Tue Aug 23 00:25:52 IST 2011,@TimCowlishaw Pryah drafted by the Raidahs is funny. What are the chances Davis thought he was drafting Richard Pryor?  He had speed...
BCLee33,Mon Aug 22 23:39:58 IST 2011,@TheBillWalton Al actually thought he was drafting Richard Pryor
BCLee33,Mon Aug 22 23:18:12 IST 2011,@darrenrovell  Al Davis wastes pick -- drafts Richard Pryor in the 3rd round.
BCLee33,Mon Aug 22 23:05:06 IST 2011,"@AdamSchefter Well, at least we know Pryor is going to a place that will help him mature into a fine player and person.  GULP."
BCLee33,Mon Aug 22 23:02:28 IST 2011,It was unfair the Mavs actually played to win.  Didn't they know the Heat were supposed to win 8 titles in a row?  http://t.co/Mnop7XB

BCLee33,Thu Aug 18 06:11:40 IST 2011,"@LaVelleNeal Thome needs 9 HRs to pass Sosa* as #7 alltime HRs.  Discounting PEDers, he'd already be #6.  Is he a HOF with his 277 BA?"
BCLee33,Thu Aug 18 02:46:25 IST 2011,@KFAN1003 Good interview.  Amazing the depth the scandal goes to
BCLee33,Wed Aug 17 03:36:04 IST 2011,@MPRnews @mprpolitics She only said what her handlers told her to say.  Someone is getting fired tonight unless Bachmann is submissive
BCLee33,Tue Aug 16 23:59:27 IST 2011,@AschNBA When will the NBA owners/players actually be meeting again?  I am tiring of the star player threats of playing overseas.
BCLee33,Tue Aug 16 23:53:20 IST 2011,Can we please stop reporting about NBA players who considering playing overseas?  I don't consider that news.
BCLee33,Tue Aug 16 21:01:03 IST 2011,@Buster_ESPN We love our *outdoor* baseball here in the Twin Cities.

BCLee33,Mon Aug 15 22:44:14 IST 2011,@DanBarreiroKFAN Amen. About as interesting as Wolves coaching speculation.
BCLee33,Mon Aug 15 22:25:23 IST 2011,@darrenrovell I would have figured the NFL draft rating to be higher than the PGA.
BCLee33,Mon Aug 15 22:00:40 IST 2011,@TCHeadCheese Was a tremendous defensive player and a class guy...should be in HOF
