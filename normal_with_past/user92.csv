klring,Sat Mar 19 23:41:57 IST 2016,"While I would prefer the X as a venue, the Minneapolis hotels, restaurants and skyway can't be beat. Great for foot traffic. #FrozenFaceoff"
klring,Sat Mar 19 23:37:56 IST 2016,While that would suck it would be better for college hockey over all instead of empty arenas. @GopherPuckLive @BeckerShawn
klring,Sat Mar 19 23:34:03 IST 2016,@SusannahDunn Suddenly hockey isn't the problem. ;-)
klring,Sat Mar 19 23:25:28 IST 2016,This Tourney is so much fun!  Seeing and talking to #UND players and wishing #UMD players the best. Great access! @TheNCHC @NCHCFFLive

klring,Sat Mar 19 20:27:53 IST 2016,@UNDSID @UNDmhockey I thought it was me. I've never seen them win at the Target Center. Let's get one today!
klring,Sat Mar 19 19:23:15 IST 2016,"The other cool thing about this vid, sure looks like @Gausmus47 is respected by the refs. @TheNCHC  @UNDmhockey #captain"
klring,Sat Mar 19 19:19:21 IST 2016,My favorite time of year!  Both Twitter and @chranked are appreciated!  Enjoying for now but it will all be over way too soon!

klring,Sat Mar 19 07:31:37 IST 2016,"I do have to say, if SCSU loses tonight, that afternoon game will be crucial. IMO, a spot in St Paul on the line. Either way it is for us."
klring,Sat Mar 19 07:27:04 IST 2016,"@SWE3DWAY Yep. The game times are all screwed up, but yes. Was expecting to have more interest in the 2nd game. ;-)"
