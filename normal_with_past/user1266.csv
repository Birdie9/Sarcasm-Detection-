Boz23,Mon Feb 29 15:12:21 IST 2016,@ranui_organics Sure is - makes me nervous as to whether I should have waited a bit longer if prices go up again. Really hard to tell.
Boz23,Mon Feb 29 15:11:08 IST 2016,@NewshubNZ And if it had been a gun?
Boz23,Mon Feb 29 15:08:06 IST 2016,@ranui_organics Glad you've got a lot of interest. I had 30 groups through before I got an offer. Have lived here since 1961 so it's scary!
Boz23,Mon Feb 29 15:06:50 IST 2016,@ranui_organics You can have your warmth if it's warmer than here! Been diabolically hot the last few days. 26 in my lounge still.

Boz23,Mon Feb 29 10:41:10 IST 2016,@ShakingStick Now there's a thought - pay as you go prisons.
Boz23,Mon Feb 29 10:37:15 IST 2016,@melulater Whangarei used to be fine til they changed the entrance to the other side. Parking's diabolical as well.
Boz23,Mon Feb 29 09:54:48 IST 2016,@ConnieBV So maybe producers should look at how many times they glorify violence in films for a start.
Boz23,Mon Feb 29 09:53:13 IST 2016,@melulater Whangarei Hospital is worse - walking up a steep hill when you've got an outpatient appointment is more than ridiculous.

Boz23,Sun Feb 28 15:45:00 IST 2016,@MissesArtech @JoelBSperanza What if we talked about mash-ups rather than cross-curricular?
Boz23,Sun Feb 28 15:43:43 IST 2016,@chasingalyx Great idea! I love my remote controlled bedroom fan. Usually set it for 4 hours. Tonight it's set for all night. #2hot2sleep

Boz23,Sun Feb 28 08:30:03 IST 2016,@chasingalyx I don't know whether to cry or scream. They told me a few weeks ago they were interested & I told them to go to the agents.

Boz23,Sun Feb 28 06:22:18 IST 2016,@melulater Definitely not beach weather in Whangarei - rain and misty clouds. Swam for ages at the beach yesterday.
Boz23,Sun Feb 28 06:13:27 IST 2016,@hunch_box Me too - but I'm also very curious about the future.
