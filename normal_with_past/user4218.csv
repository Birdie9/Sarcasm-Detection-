SBBrowns,Sun Sep 01 05:29:44 IST 2013,I guess the #Browns won't be settling for field goals this year. #NoKicker
SBBrowns,Fri Aug 30 00:54:58 IST 2013,"@Nationaltwitts there was no warning at all! There was tons of witnesses too, I could see them all laughing."
SBBrowns,Fri Aug 30 00:51:58 IST 2013,@Nationaltwitts I had no idea that trying to climb over rows of seats with a beer in each hand might be dangerous.
SBBrowns,Fri Aug 30 00:49:50 IST 2013,"@Nationaltwitts I fell in the stands last year, my knee was sore for almost a week. That should be good for a couple Gs"
SBBrowns,Fri Aug 30 00:18:25 IST 2013,@GetOffMyShane do a Google search of NHL concussions and read up. Be informed before you make stupid comments.
SBBrowns,Thu Aug 29 23:36:11 IST 2013,"@BobHavasi right, people blame Goddell but it has to be that way. To make football safe from concussions will also make it no fun to watch."
SBBrowns,Thu Aug 29 23:29:18 IST 2013,"@AJ_D9 for the first time I really think it's heading that way. We live in such a pussified society, it's pathetic."
SBBrowns,Thu Aug 29 23:24:54 IST 2013,"@AJ_D9 it's going to get worse, and it's the players fault."
SBBrowns,Thu Aug 29 23:12:09 IST 2013,What about the #NHL? Hockey players don't get concussions?
SBBrowns,Thu Aug 29 23:06:24 IST 2013,So if concussions are worth $800 million how long  until ACL and other career ending injuries are suing as well?
SBBrowns,Wed Aug 28 05:43:22 IST 2013,The #Tribe should feel right at home in Atlanta. That stadium is EMPTY!
SBBrowns,Sun Aug 25 07:28:52 IST 2013,"@chovan23 no, that's not all I want, but it's all I expect this season."
SBBrowns,Sun Aug 25 06:45:10 IST 2013,"@Ermahgerd_LAO @chovan23 Hey I think 8 or 9 is possible, hell maybe even 10. But all I'm expecting its more competitive football."
SBBrowns,Sun Aug 25 06:12:16 IST 2013,"@XCWarrior1 not a joke. I'm very optimistic about the Browns, but it's bout going to be a 1 year turn around"
SBBrowns,Sun Aug 25 06:11:29 IST 2013,"Disagree, but if it is, we'll be more competitive. It's a rebuilding process, not a quick turn around. RT @chovan23: @SBBrowns 6-10 at best"
SBBrowns,Sun Aug 25 06:04:29 IST 2013,"I still think the #Browns will be improved, but if you believed what you saw that last 2 weeks, you're just not being realistic."
SBBrowns,Thu Aug 22 07:35:50 IST 2013,"@nicky_da_greek well, I once drag raced a buddy wasted at 3am. So I won't be casting stones at anyone else."
SBBrowns,Thu Aug 22 06:52:45 IST 2013,"We were all 23 once, and most of us did some really stupid shit."
SBBrowns,Thu Aug 22 06:49:28 IST 2013,"It's like some members of the Cleveland media are looking to make our guys look bad. Unless they get suspended for speeding, I don't care."
SBBrowns,Thu Aug 22 05:34:32 IST 2013,@Nationaltwitts hahahah I've been laughing hysterically. I didn't even catch that he had it  mixed up
SBBrowns,Wed Aug 21 23:56:52 IST 2013,RT @Nationaltwitts: @SBBrowns @JayGlazer I wish #Steelers Bell had Anne Frank injury! Lock those bastards in a closet!! #gobrowns
SBBrowns,Wed Aug 21 23:55:09 IST 2013,So sad...  RT @JayGlazer: Steelers believe Le'Veon Bell has Lis Franc injury.
SBBrowns,Wed Aug 21 17:14:52 IST 2013,Who did ESPN Cleveland let go besides Roda?

SBBrowns,Fri Aug 16 22:44:33 IST 2013,"RT @Nationaltwitts: @SBBrowns Corey Dillon for Browns? Don't be ridiculous. But, I could see Charles White or Archie Griffin stepping right…"
SBBrowns,Fri Aug 16 22:10:16 IST 2013,I can't believe people are talking about signing Michael Turner. Isn't there anyone older or slower? Is Corey Dillon available?
SBBrowns,Fri Aug 16 21:36:35 IST 2013,I think it would be cool if someone streaked every game this season.

SBBrowns,Thu Aug 15 00:43:00 IST 2013,83 players currently suing the NFL over concussions. Remember that next time you blame @nflcommish for a helmet to helmet penalty.

SBBrowns,Sun Aug 11 06:58:55 IST 2013,Why does Jeff Fischer care what Bernie says on a local broadcast of a stupid preseason game? AND Bernie was right anyway! #GoBrowns

SBBrowns,Thu Aug 08 21:39:28 IST 2013,All Reynolds really needs is a slump buster. I would have taken him to Put in Bay for a weekend before DFAing him. #GoTribe
SBBrowns,Thu Aug 08 21:27:38 IST 2013,I've been trying to convince myself that Reynolds was going to get hot again and carry us for the last 2 months. So much for that. #GoTribe
