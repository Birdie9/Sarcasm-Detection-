audwrites,Tue Mar 01 05:13:45 IST 2016,I murder (fictional) people for a living.
audwrites,Tue Mar 01 05:13:30 IST 2016,In their defense...
audwrites,Tue Mar 01 05:13:19 IST 2016,My coworkers already thought I was weird. Now they probably think I'm a sociopath.
audwrites,Tue Mar 01 05:11:27 IST 2016,That awkward moment when a coworker walks into the copy room and catches you making a noose for a book out of a cat5 cable.

audwrites,Mon Feb 29 08:02:19 IST 2016,"@spacecrab Based on my research so far, though, you have never seemed to fit that."
audwrites,Mon Feb 29 08:01:44 IST 2016,@spacecrab I'm going to talk to a specialist on that topic in a couple of weeks for Starworld. Ha.
audwrites,Mon Feb 29 07:56:04 IST 2016,@paulajgarner related: there should also be a drool emoji.

audwrites,Mon Feb 29 06:29:29 IST 2016,Note to self: taking pajama bottoms OFF before putting pants ON is the correct order of operations.
audwrites,Mon Feb 29 05:32:43 IST 2016,"@chel_c_cam we shall see! My next book is less of a romance, so IDK what the plan will be."
audwrites,Mon Feb 29 05:29:44 IST 2016,"@chel_c_cam Probably not, though it's kind of killing me. This year it falls during my busy time at work. :("
audwrites,Mon Feb 29 05:27:02 IST 2016,@RaeAChang That sounds much more expedient than what I'm planning!
audwrites,Mon Feb 29 05:26:47 IST 2016,"@chel_c_cam I did that at RT. I wore my ""Everyone Loves a Lesbian"" shirt on the first day."
audwrites,Mon Feb 29 05:24:51 IST 2016,"@RaeAChang Mmm, those sound really good!"
audwrites,Mon Feb 29 05:24:40 IST 2016,@chel_c_cam Blergh. It does get better with practice.
audwrites,Mon Feb 29 05:22:42 IST 2016,@RaeAChang I like the way you're thinking...
audwrites,Mon Feb 29 05:21:42 IST 2016,"@chel_c_cam You'll definitely get better at it, but it isn't always easier. Some places just aren't safe."
audwrites,Mon Feb 29 05:16:00 IST 2016,@chel_c_cam It's EXHAUSTING.
audwrites,Mon Feb 29 05:14:30 IST 2016,"@chel_c_cam I haaaaaate this moment of decision. Because if you've only known someone three seconds, how do you know it's safe?"
audwrites,Mon Feb 29 05:07:12 IST 2016,@GretchSchreiber This is (one of many reasons) why I like you.
audwrites,Mon Feb 29 05:04:03 IST 2016,@paulajgarner At least it's already cocktail hour in your time zone! *glares at clock and pile of work* @MexHeadroom @chronophagia

audwrites,Mon Feb 29 04:52:22 IST 2016,"I really want to make cookies, which is probably a sign that I have a lot of writing to avoid."
audwrites,Mon Feb 29 04:21:57 IST 2016,@KainesCat It's super flattering! My prom dress was also dark blue. :)
audwrites,Mon Feb 29 04:20:01 IST 2016,"@KainesCat OMG, the blue is stunning!"
