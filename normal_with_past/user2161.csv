emmajanerose37,Tue Mar 01 05:29:33 IST 2016,@RCottee I can honestly say that when I was living on ¬£75 a week 18 months ago I was far more appreciative of the simpler things.
emmajanerose37,Tue Mar 01 05:28:38 IST 2016,@RCottee I know the feeling but there are a lot of rich people who are miserable.  There are people struggling financially but are happy.
emmajanerose37,Tue Mar 01 00:51:16 IST 2016,"@RCottee ah ok, I wasn't sure, thought you were going Friday the 8th"
emmajanerose37,Tue Mar 01 00:49:52 IST 2016,@RCottee are you going for it too?!!
emmajanerose37,Tue Mar 01 00:45:15 IST 2016,@RCottee oh don't say that!  I'm already preparing myself for disappointment!!  Have faith!

emmajanerose37,Tue Mar 01 00:22:56 IST 2016,"@thisisemilywood I understand, I would have done the same though, wouldn't be able to let the opportunity pass! üòú"
emmajanerose37,Tue Mar 01 00:21:40 IST 2016,Chances of getting Billy tickets at 2pm tomorrow for the final night?!!
emmajanerose37,Tue Mar 01 00:20:16 IST 2016,@thisisemilywood I just love that she doesn't try and hide it because she knows we aren't silly!  Well done for approaching her on the train
emmajanerose37,Tue Mar 01 00:05:45 IST 2016,"@thisisemilywood I'm so nervous too, I've changed my lunch hour at work to get on it at 2pm!"
emmajanerose37,Tue Mar 01 00:04:42 IST 2016,@21olijas @thisisemilywood isn't is brilliant when Ruthie messes up?!  Everyone forgives her because she knows that we know she's messed up!

emmajanerose37,Mon Feb 29 04:41:26 IST 2016,"@tj1989twit @RCottee @SaveECRewards Nope, nobody did that."
emmajanerose37,Mon Feb 29 02:04:36 IST 2016,@tj1989twit @RCottee @SaveECRewards who's blaming someone else???  Jesus so many people with so many opinions!!!
emmajanerose37,Mon Feb 29 01:48:47 IST 2016,"@SaveECRewards @RCottee @VirginTrains well you're job here is done, bye bye!"
emmajanerose37,Mon Feb 29 01:39:00 IST 2016,@SaveECRewards @RCottee @VirginTrains you're making a lot of assumptions about a situation you've walked in on halfway through!!
emmajanerose37,Mon Feb 29 01:31:14 IST 2016,@SaveECRewards @RCottee @VirginTrains ....Ryan is a bit kinder than I am!
emmajanerose37,Mon Feb 29 01:30:51 IST 2016,@SaveECRewards @RCottee @VirginTrains who said anything about reissuing???  Update yourself on the whole situation or leave!
emmajanerose37,Mon Feb 29 01:25:14 IST 2016,@RCottee @VirginTrains sit back and not say anything when at the very least a customer service failure has occurred.
