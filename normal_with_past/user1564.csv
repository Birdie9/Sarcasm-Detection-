HoopsHabit,Tue Mar 01 05:27:21 IST 2016,@SportsTalkJoe But doesn't it matter CLE overestimated his value by about 5-9 spots? That pick was terrible at the time....
HoopsHabit,Tue Mar 01 05:25:57 IST 2016,"@samesfandiari This is very true. Just unfortunate for him that his ""bust meter"" is maxed out because CLE vastly overestimated his value"
HoopsHabit,Tue Mar 01 05:22:43 IST 2016,"@Cavsanada Really? I thought he had been in the 5-10 range. In any case, getting taken No. 1 was the beginning of the end for him"
HoopsHabit,Tue Mar 01 05:20:59 IST 2016,"@samesfandiari I mean I still think he'd be a bust no matter where he was drafted, but having that No. 1 pick stigma attached makes it worse"
HoopsHabit,Tue Mar 01 05:18:32 IST 2016,@Cavsanada Exactly. Not his fault they totally botched his value by about 5-9 spots
HoopsHabit,Tue Mar 01 05:15:08 IST 2016,Anyone else feel bad for Anthony Bennett? Seems like the #Cavaliers are more to blame for him being (possibly) the worst No. 1 pick ever...
