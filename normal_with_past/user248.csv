JaredB19,Mon Mar 21 22:02:45 IST 2016,LOL seeing Ben Simmons compared to Olowokandi is probably not what he wants to see when he announces he's going pro
JaredB19,Mon Mar 21 21:27:35 IST 2016,"So stupid no matter what channel my router is on, if I run my microwave all streaming, downloading, or whatever internet usage dies"
JaredB19,Sat Mar 19 10:33:03 IST 2016,People get franchise fatigue after all this time
JaredB19,Sat Mar 19 10:32:31 IST 2016,Everything I'm hearing about new divergent series movie is its not only the worst of the series but among worst movies ever #notsurprised
JaredB19,Fri Mar 18 20:45:22 IST 2016,This is going to be a great matchup on Saturday #GSvsSA
JaredB19,Fri Mar 18 20:44:53 IST 2016,Just read a crazy stat that the Warriors haven't won a regular season game in SA since 1997 and they are 0-32 in that time span
JaredB19,Wed Mar 16 16:15:28 IST 2016,"So the ppl saying batman could never stop superman, have you ever read the dark knight returns? Granted he needed help but still possible"
JaredB19,Wed Mar 16 15:55:08 IST 2016,@TurnOfftheLight yes I have tried all of that
JaredB19,Wed Mar 16 15:54:26 IST 2016,They say jack reynor is a finalist to play Han Solo. That is a HORRIBLE choice. Guy was the second worst part of transformers aoe

JaredB19,Tue Mar 15 04:18:38 IST 2016,This offseason just makes the Broncos look cheap
JaredB19,Mon Mar 14 02:17:31 IST 2016,He deserves something for how well he played but how much was him and how much was the system and two star wrs
JaredB19,Mon Mar 14 02:16:45 IST 2016,Sadly I don't see fitz getting signed by anyone with him asking for so much after one great season and his age
JaredB19,Sun Mar 13 18:46:50 IST 2016,I mean I'm a little excited to see jones return but I just don't see him losing this match unless he is super rusty from time off
JaredB19,Sun Mar 13 18:44:34 IST 2016,"To be fair now that the hype machines have all lost there is no matchup that has me in that can't wait mode, I'm sure by 200 it will be back"

JaredB19,Sun Mar 13 18:11:12 IST 2016,I hate when athletes talk so much trash about teammates AFTER leaving. Man up and say or do something when there otherwise it's cowardly

JaredB19,Thu Mar 10 07:18:38 IST 2016,"For those arguind a guy was overpaid and not worth the money...A player is worth whatever someone is willing to pay you, take the $ and run"
JaredB19,Thu Mar 10 06:51:13 IST 2016,I really don't like the Dolphins getting Maxwell to replace Grimes. Grimes is easily a top 10 if not better CB in the league

JaredB19,Tue Mar 08 17:01:09 IST 2016,Two legends of their respective sports to retire in the same year. Feeling old to know I watched both careers start to finish #Kobe #Peyton
JaredB19,Tue Mar 08 05:19:32 IST 2016,Peyton HAS to go to tv now
JaredB19,Tue Mar 08 01:31:03 IST 2016,Did EA curse both rousey and McGregor just like the days of the Madden curse? #neverbeonEAcover
JaredB19,Mon Mar 07 04:28:07 IST 2016,"Always happy when the Lakers win, but this season particularly I'm scared about that protected draft pick"

JaredB19,Sat Mar 05 04:42:12 IST 2016,It would be one of the most disappointing outcomes if Diaz were to upset McGregor...I want McGregor to knock out Diaz in the first
