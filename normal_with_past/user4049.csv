Im_Just_Patty,Fri Aug 30 07:31:22 IST 2013,@TMobileHelp my friend walked out of a @VerizonWireless store with a brand new galaxy and an iPhone for zero down. With a good monthly rate.
Im_Just_Patty,Fri Aug 30 07:28:04 IST 2013,"@TMobileHelp doesn't matter. I was willing to pay the $25 month, but not the $236 down. I don't want to pay less over all. I wanted 0 down"
Im_Just_Patty,Fri Aug 30 07:23:18 IST 2013,Just watched the replay of Torii's walk off. Balfour looked pissed. And he got knocked down a few pegs. Good. #Tigers
Im_Just_Patty,Fri Aug 30 05:36:23 IST 2013,@TMobileHelp enough to get zero down. 9.5 years w you doesn't qualify me. It's a shame customers are not treated the same.
Im_Just_Patty,Fri Aug 30 05:34:57 IST 2013,"@TMobileHelp need a new phone. Wanted to use the 0 down you're offering right now, went to check out, they wanted $236. I'm not qualified..."

Im_Just_Patty,Tue Aug 27 08:25:14 IST 2013,@AlexisWileyFox2  I'm absolutely sick. I was so hoping it would be captured and adopted by someone who understands the breed.
