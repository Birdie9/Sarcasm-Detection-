LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 01:10:58 IST 2016,"@CapsTwittuh yeah it isn't taught everywhere but it is displayed. But my point is that in school, more so than anywhere else, it should be."
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 01:07:53 IST 2016,@CapsTwittuh I don't really understand what your point is anymore lol
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 01:07:09 IST 2016,Leap day make people crazy? I think it does.
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 01:04:05 IST 2016,@CapsTwittuh school is neutral ground then. You take it how you are taught to take it. Some people are taught not to believe it at all.
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 01:00:36 IST 2016,@CapsTwittuh I'm not in denial. I never experienced that lol I've been said this
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 01:00:09 IST 2016,@CapsTwittuh also you were saying school teaches division like with X and King and I disagreed with that as well
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:59:43 IST 2016,@CapsTwittuh I was saying that's not true and if it is it's probably cause of their parents not school
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:59:21 IST 2016,@CapsTwittuh lmao no you weren't. You said after learning about racism white and Spanish kids treat black kids differently
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:56:58 IST 2016,@CapsTwittuh lol that's what I was saying from jump. Racism isn't school's fault. You were saying it was and they shouldn't teach it lol
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:55:50 IST 2016,"@CapsTwittuh but if you're right and school teaches a ""neutral"" view of slavery then it's the family's job to make it positive or negative."
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:54:48 IST 2016,@CapsTwittuh you're still making the assumption that you know exactly how racism/slavery is being taught in schools across America lol
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:53:23 IST 2016,@CapsTwittuh it's an assumption because you don't know for sure how  slavery is being taught in schools across America.
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:51:27 IST 2016,@CapsTwittuh how do you know that for sure? You're making a really big assumption lol
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:50:15 IST 2016,@CapsTwittuh we can't speak soundly on the mass collective that's my point. We're two people. We can only speak surely on what we know.
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:49:25 IST 2016,"@CapsTwittuh slavery is negative. We learned that is was wrong. So like, why would I adopted the values of something I was taught is bad?"
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:48:46 IST 2016,@CapsTwittuh I went to school. I'm not racist or biased. Are you?
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:48:27 IST 2016,"@CapsTwittuh I could see why you say that but again, if schools were teaching racism I promise you, they'd get sued lmao"
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:47:09 IST 2016,@CapsTwittuh being different is negative? That's your own mindset lol school didn't teach you that someone else did
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:45:57 IST 2016,@CapsTwittuh PEOPLE teach their children that those differences are negative. Society teaches that. Not school. Bc they'd get sued.
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:45:33 IST 2016,"@CapsTwittuh children are taught that all races have different history, yeah. School doesn't teach that those differences are negative."
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:44:38 IST 2016,@CapsTwittuh there's a difference between being difference and being divided. You're speaking about them like they mean the same thing
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:44:14 IST 2016,@CapsTwittuh you interpret the world as you see yourself. I wasn't taught division and so I don't see that division in DIFFERENCES
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:43:35 IST 2016,@CapsTwittuh they had two different methods that actually complemented each other in the long run. Because I don't look for division lol
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:42:39 IST 2016,@CapsTwittuh but your argument is learning about black history teaches children division. If you didn't learn division from that then....
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:41:21 IST 2016,@CapsTwittuh this is where personal mentality and interpretation DOES come into play lol I did not ever see any of these things as division
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:40:25 IST 2016,"@CapsTwittuh again, you can't speak for everyone off of your experience. I didn't learn division from that. I don't know anyone who did."
