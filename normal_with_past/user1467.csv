DecayingSteve,Tue Mar 01 00:39:07 IST 2016,Man the Avs are making some noise today.
DecayingSteve,Mon Feb 29 23:00:14 IST 2016,I recently chatted with @DONTNOD_Michel about #LifeIsStrange's final choice and why it ended as it did. https://t.co/IESqCT5a7i
DecayingSteve,Mon Feb 29 22:58:43 IST 2016,For people who played through @LifeIsStrange you are probably wondering the percentage splits of who chose what at the end.
DecayingSteve,Mon Feb 29 22:53:23 IST 2016,"Vampyr looks pretty awesome, don't know what it is about Dontnod's games, but they are very intriguing."
DecayingSteve,Mon Feb 29 21:19:17 IST 2016,Adrift is looking awesome and is pretty hard to deny on #OculusRift https://t.co/ZuGllIBcrI
DecayingSteve,Mon Feb 29 21:18:21 IST 2016,"I actually love the feeling of turbulence or roller coasters, so it didn't make me sick."
DecayingSteve,Mon Feb 29 21:16:34 IST 2016,"Adrift on Oculus is definitely something for everyone to try. When I played Adrift in VR, it was similar to feelings I get during turbulence"

DecayingSteve,Mon Feb 29 08:43:16 IST 2016,Animated short film should be the WTF Oscar. #Oscars
DecayingSteve,Mon Feb 29 08:11:36 IST 2016,Turns out #TheOscars aren't totally scripted. See where the Mad Max people are sitting.
DecayingSteve,Mon Feb 29 08:07:38 IST 2016,"Yeah, the music to play people off during their speech is one of the more offensive parts of #TheOscars"

DecayingSteve,Sat Feb 20 05:33:23 IST 2016,@GreatWallofChin I feel like Takkar would want you to have a birthday donut right now.

DecayingSteve,Fri Feb 19 21:36:43 IST 2016,"#PvZGW2 does some new things and some old quite well. Only gripe was why limit Garden Ops waves? Nothing needed to change, so why do it?"
DecayingSteve,Fri Feb 19 21:35:13 IST 2016,Love the Garden Warfare series for its ability to not take itself too seriously. I think the industry could use more of that.
DecayingSteve,Fri Feb 19 21:15:42 IST 2016,Ubi has two of the three biggest new IP launches ever and #TheDivision could make it 3 out of 4. Impressive.
