neil_saints,Fri Nov 20 13:21:22 IST 2015,@BradBeauJordyn how many players have been occasionally late for training? He's not the first & he won't be the last.
neil_saints,Fri Nov 20 13:19:15 IST 2015,"@srahul_35 @Lee_Skinner23 I think he'll play most of the year in the seniors Rahul, developing a chemistry with the young blokes."
neil_saints,Fri Nov 20 13:17:26 IST 2015,"Jake Carlisle late for training. Slack, especially after everything that's happened. But the reporting is hysterical. Slow news day."
neil_saints,Fri Nov 20 13:12:54 IST 2015,@srahul_35 @Lee_Skinner23 he doesn't need to burst on to the scene to kick 30-40 if he plays most weeks. 1-2 goals a week on average.

neil_saints,Fri Nov 20 13:07:21 IST 2015,@Lee_Skinner23 @saintslugger @Michael_60 @Shaebee22 if McCartin kicks 30-40 goals & Bruce 50-60 we play finals. The kid will make it.

neil_saints,Wed Nov 18 14:08:58 IST 2015,@Lee_Skinner23 thanks Lee. I must admit I liked what I saw. I think he'll be better than some of the earlier picks.
neil_saints,Wed Nov 18 14:04:45 IST 2015,@BradBeauJordyn after bids on Sydney's academy players they may not have enough points for Dunkley. He may nominate for the draft.
neil_saints,Wed Nov 18 14:00:31 IST 2015,I've just read an interesting article on Josh Dunkley & watched some highlights. Is pick 14 too early for him? He'll be a player.
neil_saints,Tue Nov 17 15:26:30 IST 2015,@PuttyMcK but someone else will bob up and fill the vacuum. The only player who was irreplaceable was Shane Keith Warne. He was a genius.
neil_saints,Tue Nov 17 15:21:44 IST 2015,@PuttyMcK It's sad. But he's happy. He's cooked.

neil_saints,Sat Nov 14 14:30:05 IST 2015,@AllanG49 @Dallas_corey @Moondarra @saintslugger it will. I predict that when we our flag the dam wall will burst. We'll win several.
neil_saints,Sat Nov 14 14:28:31 IST 2015,@Dallas_corey @Moondarra @saintslugger that night I was inconsolable. More so than in 1997. We were the best side in 2009.

neil_saints,Sat Nov 14 14:22:39 IST 2015,@Dallas_corey @Moondarra @saintslugger We blew it in 2009. But we had a very big lead in 1971 & had them. We never had a big lead in 2009.
neil_saints,Sat Nov 14 14:17:13 IST 2015,@Dallas_corey @Moondarra @saintslugger Trott was BOG at that point. We were 28 points ahead & surging. It changed the momentum.
