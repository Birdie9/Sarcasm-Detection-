portiaburk31,Sat Feb 27 01:49:46 IST 2016,@BrandonBSonnier @prachidhir but still prefer tom dead either with Axe or he's sailing and sharks eat him

portiaburk31,Sat Feb 27 00:56:53 IST 2016,@BrandonBSonnier @chacksontian @miller2275 liz keeps tom alive she can provide him with a comfortable normal life as long as she lives him
portiaburk31,Sat Feb 27 00:53:07 IST 2016,@BrandonBSonnier @chacksontian @miller2275 and tom just goes along with it letting her think that he is tom not jacob
portiaburk31,Sat Feb 27 00:51:24 IST 2016,@BrandonBSonnier @chacksontian @miller2275 but who she wants him to be
portiaburk31,Sat Feb 27 00:51:06 IST 2016,@BrandonBSonnier @chacksontian @miller2275 personally right now she is looking at tom with a pair of dark glasses not seeing who he is.
portiaburk31,Sat Feb 27 00:49:14 IST 2016,@BrandonBSonnier @chacksontian @miller2275 but IMO he's not and liz is looking at the wrong guy for this stability
portiaburk31,Sat Feb 27 00:48:10 IST 2016,@BrandonBSonnier @chacksontian @miller2275 tom is her child's father so she wants him to be stable and good
portiaburk31,Sat Feb 27 00:47:03 IST 2016,@BrandonBSonnier @chacksontian @miller2275 or without tom
portiaburk31,Sat Feb 27 00:46:06 IST 2016,@BrandonBSonnier @chacksontian @miller2275 I really do think she wants to start anew but she doesn't act like she can be without a man

portiaburk31,Fri Feb 26 22:54:05 IST 2016,@revti_p just watch her from afar Berlin hired tom to get intimate and marry her
portiaburk31,Fri Feb 26 22:53:26 IST 2016,@revti_p and kept the fact he hired tom originally a secret that he eventually told and he never hired tom to marry her
portiaburk31,Fri Feb 26 22:52:03 IST 2016,@revti_p technically he didn't lie to her about hiring tom in fact he told mostly the truth about tom
portiaburk31,Fri Feb 26 22:49:00 IST 2016,@BrandonBSonnier of course those were Liz's assumptions
portiaburk31,Fri Feb 26 22:44:25 IST 2016,@revti_p @BrandonBSonnier he has not lied to liz so far he has hidden things from her but he has not lied
portiaburk31,Fri Feb 26 22:42:56 IST 2016,@BrandonBSonnier I'm with dembe on that liz needs to know the truth about her mother
portiaburk31,Fri Feb 26 22:42:02 IST 2016,@BrandonBSonnier plus he's hiding things from her that she needs to know
