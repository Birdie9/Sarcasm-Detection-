markd721,Sun Feb 28 22:29:13 IST 2016,@29alltime looking forward to it! Finally!
markd721,Sun Feb 28 22:28:13 IST 2016,Checking out #windowsweekly nice to see these guys talking about actual windows devices. #twit
markd721,Fri Feb 26 23:58:58 IST 2016,Looks like it's just an update to #EMUI still on 5.1.1 #huawei #honor 5x
markd721,Fri Feb 26 23:47:17 IST 2016,I wonder if it's marshmallow #huawei #honor 5x
markd721,Fri Feb 26 23:44:45 IST 2016,Let's see what this update I'm being prompted to install is all about. #huawei #honor 5x https://t.co/JeeVceLO7I
markd721,Fri Feb 26 23:41:15 IST 2016,Saying that the #atlanta track surface is aging is a gross understatement. #nascar That track looks like ass!
markd721,Fri Feb 19 03:08:30 IST 2016,@palmsolo they probably figure you are just going to return it anyway.

markd721,Mon Feb 15 18:22:12 IST 2016,@maryjofoley @thurrott listening to the latest #windowsweekly It almost seems that iPhone drone Leo Laporte wants WP to fail. #tool

markd721,Tue Jan 26 22:32:23 IST 2016,honor 5X Review https://t.co/9YKgf69PJu   Kind of suprised this only got a 6. Oh well. Typical Phone Arena #Honor5x
markd721,Tue Jan 26 16:58:50 IST 2016,I need to update my #raspberrypi a little more often.
markd721,Tue Jan 26 16:55:43 IST 2016,Haven't updated in a while though. Both are taking some time. #raspberrypi
markd721,Tue Jan 26 16:54:56 IST 2016,It's amazing how much quicker a #raspberrypi 2 is at doing an update than the pi A+ with only 700mhz single core cpu and 256mb ram. #pi
markd721,Fri Jan 22 02:19:10 IST 2016,Damn! I forgot about these multimeters I had laying around. https://t.co/kICXFtQWkz

markd721,Thu Nov 26 06:56:34 IST 2015,@beatsone and #applemusic is trash. How do you expect anyone to listen with all the disconnects. Ain't getting my money after 3 months!
markd721,Sat Nov 21 22:33:41 IST 2015,@verge #lumia920 review. You guys have sunk to a new low. Sad
markd721,Fri Nov 20 01:05:53 IST 2015,"I guess if you listen to bieber and Adele it's OK. Oh that's right, Adele doesn't want to be on #beats1. Haha"
markd721,Fri Nov 20 01:04:22 IST 2015,Not that the music is anything I like on there. #beats1
markd721,Fri Nov 20 01:03:48 IST 2015,Let's see if this #applemusic update fixes the crashing problem on #beats1 like it says it does.
markd721,Tue Nov 17 20:15:47 IST 2015,@rmcoplon agreed. Most of the books in reading are $20-30. A few of those a month and im actually saving money.
markd721,Tue Nov 17 20:12:48 IST 2015,Reading a new #raspberrypi book and it looks like safari just went down. No complaints. First time its gone down for me ever. #safari

markd721,Wed Nov 04 23:57:31 IST 2015,@YESNetwork Sounds to me that the yanks are doing some damage control in anticipation of a possible trade.
markd721,Wed Nov 04 21:48:28 IST 2015,@RaspberryPiHack Awesome!! Thanks!! #MagPi #RaspberryPi
markd721,Wed Nov 04 21:35:01 IST 2015,@Mets why all the negativity.  lol
