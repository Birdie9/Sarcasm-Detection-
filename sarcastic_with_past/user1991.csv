Squeege800,Sun Feb 28 07:37:57 IST 2016,The fray to play now at the stadium series... nothing gets my blood pumping like the fray!  #sarcasm #cmonman
Squeege800,Sun Feb 28 06:03:10 IST 2016,@adsroundtable I think there would be too many stoppages to replace the glass that gets broken... I'm all for it!
Squeege800,Sun Feb 28 05:33:21 IST 2016,"@adsroundtable @cwatts78 And I'm slightly ok with that,  however I am biased.  I enjoy listening to your opinions on it all, thank you!"
Squeege800,Sun Feb 28 05:27:25 IST 2016,@adsroundtable @cwatts78 The joys of a farm team. Is CHI just filling in holes or are they selling to push for another cup? Or both?
Squeege800,Sun Feb 28 05:23:03 IST 2016,@adsroundtable @cwatts78 Maybe... Florida or Chicago might take him too though.  They are taking everyone!
Squeege800,Sun Feb 28 05:14:50 IST 2016,@adsroundtable @cwatts78 I blame the Internet for over hype... it's way too addicting not to watch though :)
Squeege800,Sun Feb 28 04:14:10 IST 2016,"@cwatts78 @adsroundtable Has been pretty quiet,  can't spill the beans right ;)"
Squeege800,Sun Feb 28 04:13:31 IST 2016,@NHLFREEAGENTS I'm scared to see what happens...
Squeege800,Sun Feb 28 03:58:50 IST 2016,@CincyCyclones @USBankArena Budish!
Squeege800,Sat Feb 27 12:44:54 IST 2016,Getting tacos and a puzzle piece!
Squeege800,Sat Feb 27 09:16:41 IST 2016,"@adsroundtable At the rate these hat tricks are coming for this team,  I need to bring another hat along to games! #goads"
Squeege800,Sat Feb 27 09:11:15 IST 2016,I want taco bell... and another puzzle piece! @tacobell Do I need a hash tag? #iforget

Squeege800,Fri Feb 26 08:48:51 IST 2016,@FlaPanthers What's with the rats? I love it!
Squeege800,Fri Feb 26 08:39:49 IST 2016,"@Alex_Bryzboa @ArizonaCoyotes He was sprawled out making a save and a panther fell and kneed him directly on his back, right side."

Squeege800,Tue Feb 23 08:20:07 IST 2016,@Zia0n @ArizonaCoyotes Or if they would have called Ovi on the high stick on Murphy...

1: Alcohol
2: Food
3: Wisconsin based Sports"
Squeege800,Tue Feb 16 09:13:13 IST 2016,@ArizonaCoyotes This has to be the coolest feeling ever for Nathan!  Congrats to his call up for tonight!  Hope Lindback is ok though too.
Squeege800,Sun Feb 14 08:56:51 IST 2016,@adsroundtable I'll admit 2 years ago I was a hater but last year I came to my senses. #InHuttonWeTrust

Squeege800,Sat Feb 13 05:15:52 IST 2016,@mlbtraderumors I honestly think Davis will do better with the As but that throwing arm still is a problem
Squeege800,Mon Feb 08 09:27:09 IST 2016,I dont get how Budweiser drinkers care about their company after they were called so many explicite names by their own company. #SuperBowl

Squeege800,Mon Feb 08 08:36:55 IST 2016,RT @JOEL9ONE: Von Miller for MVP. I'm serious. He's the most valuable player in this game.

Squeege800,Mon Feb 08 05:52:31 IST 2016,@Kevin_Swiontek @cwatts78 @ProFootballTalk Refs call what they want to call. Ask Brett Favre.
Squeege800,Mon Feb 08 05:47:53 IST 2016,@Kevin_Swiontek @cwatts78 @ProFootballTalk That's just football... happens more often than you think
Squeege800,Mon Feb 08 05:47:04 IST 2016,@cwatts78 @ProFootballTalk They were off the field technically ;)

Squeege800,Mon Feb 08 05:44:40 IST 2016,@ProFootballTalk That call was made to keep Carolina in it early... that's just a football thing
Squeege800,Mon Feb 08 05:34:26 IST 2016,That's a catch #SuperBowl #SB50

Squeege800,Sat Feb 06 11:02:23 IST 2016,@adsroundtable @brainard66 This organization should be stacked for years with good players. No more trading :)

Squeege800,Fri Feb 05 10:55:50 IST 2016,"@DERKLOW @NHL As I stated,  young refs will learn when they go back to the ECHL! :)"
Squeege800,Fri Feb 05 10:54:32 IST 2016,"@DERKLOW @NHL OK I just watched it, he was hit... but he never really made any contact that I could see... OK that was also a bad call..."
Squeege800,Fri Feb 05 10:52:07 IST 2016,"@DERKLOW @NHL That's the problem, I haven't yet I just heard the facts but never heard the push if it did happen... I'll watch it now :)"
Squeege800,Fri Feb 05 10:50:01 IST 2016,"@DERKLOW @NHL Hard to say,  that disallowed goal had all the right facts to be called what it was... but great game,  onto the next!"

Squeege800,Fri Feb 05 10:42:18 IST 2016,@bdjac82 @NHLBlackhawks I need to rewatch it but from the facts I heard it was a good call...
Squeege800,Fri Feb 05 10:40:59 IST 2016,"@celeste43_ I've never been a Crawford fan,  the hawks D is so good they make up for his mistakes. Yet Crawford is awesome come playoffs."
Squeege800,Fri Feb 05 10:38:14 IST 2016,@TStout97 I'm rewatching the game... I came in late... these refs were a joke all around
