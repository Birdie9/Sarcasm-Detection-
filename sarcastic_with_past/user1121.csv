mrthebomb,Sat Jan 02 14:00:07 IST 2016,@UrmstonLordMUFC @allofmufc of course they won't.  We get a draw today and they'll want his head to roll.
mrthebomb,Sat Jan 02 13:20:22 IST 2016,@SheikhItHaris @Schweiniction he's living off making a goalie sub? What the fuck you on. He lay the foundation at Bayern and Barca.
mrthebomb,Sat Jan 02 13:04:39 IST 2016,@MartialAce then for a small period in Spain with Madrid he never scored.So you wanted to put trust in a striker who had failed in 2 seasons
mrthebomb,Sat Jan 02 13:03:44 IST 2016,@MartialAce Hernadez needed another club.  Moyes gave him loads of chances and he wasn't scoring.

mrthebomb,Sat Jan 02 03:52:10 IST 2016,@mufc_fan_saf @jimmymcbride1 or we offer double what he's worth. Ie something stupid like 60mil

mrthebomb,Sat Jan 02 03:47:34 IST 2016,@SherifMUFC not sure about that. Think a big offer and the fact his agent is a giant bellend might help.
