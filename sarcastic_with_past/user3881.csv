MattCosgriff,Sat Apr 04 02:31:54 IST 2015,@RSNSportRadio not sure about it being a surprise winning last start. It was heavily backed from $7.00 into $4.60

MattCosgriff,Tue Mar 24 10:38:07 IST 2015,@jkissick30 @AlexDonnelly14 the Albury Guineas looks to be very truly run. Expecting the winner to be running on from the rear late
MattCosgriff,Tue Mar 24 06:40:48 IST 2015,@AlexDonnelly14 look on the positives mate. Unbeaten at Albury 4/4 and CD 2/2 The Monstar strong chance to win the Flat Knacker
MattCosgriff,Tue Mar 24 06:25:20 IST 2015,@AlexDonnelly14 it is unfortunate. Definitely strengthens the chance of those in the top half of the field and weakens others

MattCosgriff,Fri Mar 20 09:40:33 IST 2015,@RicFinlay if that's the case then why are there still bails on the stumps when they light up anyway? Bails have to come off
MattCosgriff,Fri Mar 20 09:34:23 IST 2015,@RicFinlay ridiculous Ric. The bails existence is they have to be removed to define a wicket. Been that way forever. Who cares about lights

MattCosgriff,Sat Feb 28 05:17:41 IST 2015,@The_Cobalt_Kid @AtThePicnics yeah that ride on Reach Out last night at $10 and win in the Launnie Cup Wednesday were real disasters.
MattCosgriff,Sat Feb 28 03:47:13 IST 2015,@carlton_hero thats career stats. When you're an international 37 G1 winning rider and 76 G1 placings its fair to be a factor in the majors
MattCosgriff,Sat Feb 28 03:34:57 IST 2015,Thurlow as much as $31.00/$5.50 in Blue Duamond not the worst win/place bet you could have. C Williams riding and form not exactly hopeless
