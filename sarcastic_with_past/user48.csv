SailorJoeV,Tue Mar 22 03:37:27 IST 2016,@LodiSilverado That doesn't mean that he is supporting abortion.
SailorJoeV,Tue Mar 22 03:37:07 IST 2016,"@LodiSilverado All this did was ensure that if someone chooses to kill their baby, they don't have to worry about a secondary infection."
SailorJoeV,Tue Mar 22 03:20:29 IST 2016,@LodiSilverado How thick are you? Can you define what is 'enabling' about this?  @CosmicOdyssey
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 10:05:33 IST 2016,@PeaceRude It is not possible to do both? @LRRMV
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 10:02:06 IST 2016,"@PeaceRude Again with the ad hominems? Tell you what, I apologize for confusing you. Have a wonderful night!  @LRRMV"
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 09:53:05 IST 2016,"@PeaceRude Resorting to name calling?  Tisk, tisk. I thought you were better than that... @LRRMV"

SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 09:07:11 IST 2016,"@PeaceRude And as far as education goes, should I aim for an M.S. to go with my A.S., A.A. and B.S.? @LRRMV"
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 09:06:31 IST 2016,"@PeaceRude Again with the oversimplification, bud. Could 58 followers also mean I dont care about feeding the twitter beast? @LRRMV"
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 08:46:01 IST 2016,@PatriotVote2016 is it too much to ask for proper punctuation?
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 08:15:18 IST 2016,"@PeaceRude Boy, you are thick. Can you tell me what 'detest' means? @Patriotic_Me @LRRMV"
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 08:12:26 IST 2016,"@PeaceRude I cant support the right to free speech, detest the method, AND be local? Seems overly simple to me... @Patriotic_Me @LRRMV"
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 07:49:38 IST 2016,@PeaceRude Thanks for oversimplifying that. Care to make any more uneducated comments? @Patriotic_Me @LRRMV @PatriotByGod
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 04:57:29 IST 2016,"@nuclearbuckeye @NobamaDotCom @LRRMV @PatriotByGod That is true. As I said, I don't agree with the tactics, only the right to the message."
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 04:50:44 IST 2016,"@James6143 In that case, thanks for your service. Not all who disagree are unaware of that life... @LRRMV @PatriotByGod"
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 04:48:29 IST 2016,@MomsDemand Is this another one of those 90% based on like 400 people?
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 04:10:45 IST 2016,@James6143 @LRRMV @PatriotByGod A vague location is hardly an invitation...
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 04:06:56 IST 2016,"@nuclearbuckeye @NobamaDotCom @LRRMV @PatriotByGod Because people have value, even if you don't want to understand that."
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 04:06:04 IST 2016,@Linelsas @NobamaDotCom @PatriotByGod @LRRMV And how did that work on t for the aggressors?
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 03:57:41 IST 2016,@James6143 I prefer discourse. @LRRMV @PatriotByGod
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 03:56:19 IST 2016,@James6143 @LRRMV @PatriotByGod So why bother?
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 03:55:36 IST 2016,@Linelsas @NobamaDotCom @PatriotByGod @LRRMV I was unaware that that was just a conflict of ideas..
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 03:41:15 IST 2016,@James6143 @LRRMV @PatriotByGod Careful who you invite. Someone may show up.
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 03:39:20 IST 2016,Not advocating violence? Could have fooled me... https://t.co/Z9o6307OT1
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 03:37:44 IST 2016,I wonder if #trump supporters will still advocate violence when the tables are turned...
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 03:33:07 IST 2016,@James6143 @LRRMV @PatriotByGod  That is not how I exercise my rights.
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 03:32:29 IST 2016,@NobamaDotCom @PatriotByGod @LRRMV  When has the advocation of violence ever solved the problem?
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 03:30:43 IST 2016,@Patriotic_Me @LRRMV @PatriotByGod What makes you think it's not my neighborhood?
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 03:27:46 IST 2016,@LRRMV Nor do they have to listen to you message.
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 03:27:23 IST 2016,"@PatriotByGod Caredul what you tweat, this could be considered a threat. @NobamaDotCom @LRRMV"
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 03:26:35 IST 2016,"@LRRMV Be careful with your assumptions, they could come back on you...  @NobamaDotCom @PatriotByGod"
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 03:25:12 IST 2016,@James6143 So everyone who breaks the law should be shot? @LRRMV @PatriotByGod
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 03:22:57 IST 2016,@LRRMV You do know that free speech listening to something you would spend your life opposing?
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 03:21:51 IST 2016,"@NobamaDotCom And they did. Maybe we should have respect enough for their message, even if their tactics sucks. @LRRMV @PatriotByGod"
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 03:19:19 IST 2016,"@PatriotByGod @LRRMV I am not agreeing with their tactics, only that they have a right to the message"
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 03:18:43 IST 2016,@LRRMV @PatriotByGod And they paid the price. It is still an exercise of free speech. Just cause you don't agree with it...
SailorJoeV,Sun Mar 20 03:06:10 IST 2016,"@LRRMV  @PatriotByGod Think carefully here. Like it our not, those are Americans exercising a right."
SailorJoeV,Sat Mar 19 14:55:19 IST 2016,@LRRMV Like he did when his advisors told him not to use junk bonds and he did anyway? @irritatedwoman
SailorJoeV,Fri Mar 18 22:08:59 IST 2016,"@tom_lewisville Just because it's expected, doesn't mean it should be accepted. @MomsDemand"
