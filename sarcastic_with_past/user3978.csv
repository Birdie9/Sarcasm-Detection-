oaklandishdude,Sun Mar 29 20:44:33 IST 2015,@WhisperNClamor again you read what you want. Davies in his own comment walks back what he said. Every other comment disagreed with him.

oaklandishdude,Sun Mar 29 20:19:29 IST 2015,@WhisperNClamor you didn't. The other comments throughly reject what Davies was saying. You heard what you want to hear.

oaklandishdude,Sun Mar 29 02:30:39 IST 2015,I love it when people call you disparaging names and then claim they are not using ad hominem. Oh why must there be so many igronent people

oaklandishdude,Sun Mar 29 02:07:31 IST 2015,@ANnews99 wow a difference of opinion does not make a troll. Lobing in ad hominem does which in this case makes you the troll.
oaklandishdude,Sun Mar 29 02:06:01 IST 2015,@ANnews99 you are just upset because someone called your illogical statements. Just like the non sequitur last tweet.

oaklandishdude,Sun Mar 29 01:58:22 IST 2015,@ANnews99 @kitsonde I posted a linked that disputed that claim. Logic was never used to undermine your claim.
oaklandishdude,Sun Mar 29 01:56:42 IST 2015,@ANnews99 @kitsonde nice strawman. Was not not talking about Hitler. You made a claim that paintings has religious/spiritual meaning
oaklandishdude,Sun Mar 29 01:47:47 IST 2015,@ANnews99 @kitsonde the link to the new yorker. It is laughable arrogant to know the meaning of those drawings. Unless you were there.
