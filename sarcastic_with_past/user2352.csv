SteveLichtenst1,Fri Feb 26 07:58:05 IST 2016,Can't wait to see what all-bench lineup Brown throws out there in the 2nd quarter. #sarcasm #Nets
SteveLichtenst1,Fri Feb 26 07:53:30 IST 2016,"I would say that the #Nets should know to make Teletovic put the ball on the floor, but there's only a few left who've played with him."
SteveLichtenst1,Fri Feb 26 07:47:17 IST 2016,#Nets just went about 5 offensive possessions without Lopez even getting a touch.
SteveLichtenst1,Fri Feb 26 07:36:12 IST 2016,"OK, this #NJDevils game is over. Time to switch over to my other favorite train wreck--the #BrooklynNets."
SteveLichtenst1,Fri Feb 26 07:10:07 IST 2016,#NJDevils down 5-1. Better effort in 2nd but not nearly enough to make up for the dumpster fire of a 1st period.
SteveLichtenst1,Fri Feb 26 06:54:41 IST 2016,#NJDevils get screwed. Why bother with replay?
SteveLichtenst1,Fri Feb 26 06:34:34 IST 2016,Good to see the #Devils made it to the arena. Boucher cuts it to 3-1.
SteveLichtenst1,Fri Feb 26 06:31:54 IST 2016,New toward lines in addition to new goalie for #NJDevils to start 2nd period.
SteveLichtenst1,Fri Feb 26 06:14:49 IST 2016,"4 #NJDevils (Josefson, Blandisi, Merrill & Severson) were minus-3 in 1st period. Something for Hynes to think about in intermission."
SteveLichtenst1,Fri Feb 26 06:11:09 IST 2016,Have to go to Kincaid in 2nd period. Save Schneider for tomorrow.
SteveLichtenst1,Fri Feb 26 06:10:10 IST 2016,"CBJ just quicker than the #NJDevils. Could easily be 5-0 instead of 2-0. At the rate NJ produces goals, it may as well be."
SteveLichtenst1,Fri Feb 26 05:51:16 IST 2016,We may see Kincaid in net tonight after all. Not Schneider's fault however. Blandisi just stared as the Jackets put another one in.
SteveLichtenst1,Fri Feb 26 05:45:51 IST 2016,#NJDevils look lazy in Columbus after big win over NYR. Josefson goof gives CBJ early lead.
SteveLichtenst1,Fri Feb 26 02:47:06 IST 2016,Can't say I'm happy about Sean Marks Move #2. This buyout is much different than D-Will or Bargs. Best wishes to #JoeJesus.
SteveLichtenst1,Thu Feb 25 23:15:21 IST 2016,"@mytoemytoe Not arguing that.  However, priorities are $$$$, fit, & team's chances at winning.  Then comes secondary considerations."
SteveLichtenst1,Thu Feb 25 23:11:50 IST 2016,@mytoemytoe I think that logic is overstating the impact.  Future free agents won't care about this when looking at offers.
SteveLichtenst1,Thu Feb 25 23:10:02 IST 2016,"The #Nets are bad all over, but they have very few 3s on roster, especially with RHJ out.  Who will take Joe's minutes?"
SteveLichtenst1,Thu Feb 25 23:08:29 IST 2016,"If Johnson was taking minutes from a young player who could have a future, then sure a buyout makes sense for #Nets. But that's not the case"
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 20:40:29 IST 2016,#NJDevils win over Rangers makes it easier for Shero to justify standing pat at trade deadline.  See new post at: https://t.co/lE4wLgrJTj
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 10:12:26 IST 2016,If only the #Nets lineup on the court was as good as their TV & radio lineup.
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 10:11:17 IST 2016,"Don't get many chances to catch @ChrisCarrino & @TimCapstraw, but I feel treated after listening on my drive home from the @Devils game."
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 08:41:16 IST 2016,"Kalinin swears he knew about Howe hat trick: ""I'm from Siberia, but we get internet."""
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 08:10:09 IST 2016,"Empty netter makes it 5-2. Unlike with the #Nets, I don't appear to be a jinx for the #NJDevils. They're 2-0 at the Rock with me there."
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 08:07:03 IST 2016,I'm not sure Kalinin knows who Gordie Howe is. #NJDevils #GordieHowehattrick
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 08:04:36 IST 2016,Kalinin wraps up a nice night with a gorgeous move to beat Lundqvist on a breakaway. 4-2 Devils.
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:46:05 IST 2016,Now 7 minutes of PP time wasted by #NJDevils. No idea what Hynes thinks Josefson brings to the first unit. Guy never moves off the half wall
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:42:16 IST 2016,I will admit that Gionta would have probably fallen even if Brassard's stick wasn't near him.
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:40:30 IST 2016,Lundqvist denies Tootoo as major PP ends. #NJDevils  miss on big opportunity.
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:37:36 IST 2016,Rangers finally shutting down #NJDevils backdoor play on PP.
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:36:39 IST 2016,Not a very good first half of PP for #NJDevils. Rangers have had best chance.
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:27:20 IST 2016,"@BrenBren2424 It's a rule. Besides, he jus.t tweeted a thank you to the #NJDevils for their pre game ceremony for Mike Nichols."
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:21:37 IST 2016,@BrenBren2424 I heard. Can't see it from the heavens here.
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:20:30 IST 2016,Miller got tossed for putting on the foil? #NYRvsNJD
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:18:18 IST 2016,#NJDeviils will start the 3rd period with 4:59 of power play time.
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:16:44 IST 2016,"I didn't see what Miller did to deserve a match penalty, but that's a huge break for the #NJDeviils."
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:14:17 IST 2016,@HartnettHockey Or to have him off the ice for 5 minutes in the 3rd period.
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:13:17 IST 2016,Kalinin & Miller give the fans more to scream about. Not the usual combatants. #NYRvsNJD
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:11:49 IST 2016,2 quick thoughts on 2nd period: Rangers clearly miss McDonagh & Staal in back & #NJDevils played like the desperate team they are.
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:08:50 IST 2016,"#NJDeviils get away with a pick, Rangers get away with a hook, & Stempniak beats Lundqvist for a 3-2 lead."
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:02:12 IST 2016,"Both goalies have been outstanding tonight, stats be damned. #NYRvsNJD"
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:00:51 IST 2016,"@HartnettHockey TBH, he has a hard time staying upright in general. He's always on the ice. That wasn't even a penalty on McIlrath."
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 06:52:30 IST 2016,Blandisi failed on his 1st attempt to go to Palmieri on opposite side of crease & Rangers cleared. Connected with Palms on 2nd try. 2-2 game
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 06:49:45 IST 2016,At least #NJDevils are putting up a fight. Good pressure results in Rangers penalty.
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 06:47:06 IST 2016,Highway robbery by Henrik on Palmieri.
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 06:39:05 IST 2016,Gionta can't buy one. Missed the net from 10 feet out in front. #NJDevils
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 06:15:59 IST 2016,"#NJDevils were better in last 10 minutes of 1st period, but they deservingly trail, 2-1."
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 06:12:57 IST 2016,Kalinin has been the #NJDevils best forward so far.
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 06:02:47 IST 2016,Blandisi & Kalinin swap lines. #NJDevils
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 05:54:01 IST 2016,"#NjDevils down 2-1 & reeling. Other than their goal, they've barely possessed the puck in the Rangers zone."
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 05:52:10 IST 2016,Rangers finally bury one after several missed glorious chances. Hayes with the put away of a juicy rebound.
