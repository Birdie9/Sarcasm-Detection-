red_monster,Tue Mar 01 01:49:19 IST 2016,@ARegularTony I just don't see why you would. I think there is a negative view on Joe because he was drafted so high and can't live up to it
red_monster,Tue Mar 01 01:44:04 IST 2016,@ARegularTony how bout Stajan? You a big Bollig fan?
red_monster,Tue Mar 01 01:43:12 IST 2016,@ARegularTony such as? Moving Jones wouldn't be more prudent? Considering age and versatility?
red_monster,Tue Mar 01 01:40:10 IST 2016,@ARegularTony but why? You want a 6th rounder for a youngish affordable utility player who can play both center and wing?

red_monster,Tue Mar 01 00:59:23 IST 2016,@rashid_tayyab I don't know why you would. He's a cheap utility player with no leverage going into RFA status. Need Role players.

red_monster,Tue Feb 23 06:05:42 IST 2016,I think we should all take a moment today to thank Tim Erixon for the beautiful bounty of talent he has bestowed upon us flames fans
red_monster,Tue Feb 23 04:51:06 IST 2016,@12watchdog I honestly believe this trade makes sense for both teams. As much as I would love to say we fleeced the Nucks
red_monster,Tue Feb 23 04:15:37 IST 2016,@GranlundMa best of luck in Vancouver Markus.
red_monster,Tue Feb 23 03:41:42 IST 2016,I don't think it's that much of a steal for the Flames. Granlund is a very decent prospect. We're deep at the position anyway

red_monster,Mon Feb 22 23:18:31 IST 2016,A few things I want to see post trade deadline for the Flames. The first is Nakladal getting top 4 mins the rest of the season.
red_monster,Thu Feb 18 05:46:50 IST 2016,@24thminute haha and I completely disagree that it's irrelevant. It's certainly a polarizing discussion
red_monster,Thu Feb 18 05:04:06 IST 2016,@24thminute I totally agree that it was intentional. But that's opinion. There certainly is reasonable doubt in this situation tho.
