JMorrison39,Fri Feb 26 19:50:42 IST 2016,It's hard to believe they built that team on consistent early to mid first round picks too #sarcasm
JMorrison39,Fri Feb 26 19:46:57 IST 2016,Can't wait to watch the Blackhawks steamroll their way to another Stanley Cup
JMorrison39,Fri Feb 26 09:18:50 IST 2016,"@TonyTrovato Good, treated like what he is."

JMorrison39,Fri Feb 26 06:44:34 IST 2016,None of this would matter though if the CBJ would just learn how to start a season.
JMorrison39,Fri Feb 26 06:35:45 IST 2016,"Think about the Caps without Ovechkin, Pens w/o Crosby or Malkin, TB without Stamkos, even Florida with Ekblad."
JMorrison39,Fri Feb 26 06:33:59 IST 2016,Let that sink in and tell me you'd still rather have these wins than a potential franchise player. A top pick.
JMorrison39,Fri Feb 26 06:33:18 IST 2016,This team has 2 playoff appearances in 15 years. 50% of the league makes the playoffs every year. CBJ have done it twice.
JMorrison39,Fri Feb 26 06:30:54 IST 2016,Congrats to the CBJ on making another pointless late season push. Cant wait to watch the 9th pick be traded in two years for some scrub vet.

JMorrison39,Thu Feb 25 23:20:51 IST 2016,"Only two weeks till Crew season. After the Jackets and Browns, it'll be good to watch a competent organization again."
JMorrison39,Thu Feb 25 06:26:46 IST 2016,@TonyTrovato Looks like he gave him the old forearm shiver
JMorrison39,Thu Feb 25 06:16:36 IST 2016,@TonyTrovato If only they had the Kesler flop. I'd use it like an email signature on my tweets.
JMorrison39,Thu Feb 25 06:14:32 IST 2016,"@TonyTrovato my boy, chopping at that budget https://t.co/QEfe5LOpWO"
JMorrison39,Thu Feb 25 06:13:14 IST 2016,@TonyTrovato Excellent gif work
JMorrison39,Thu Feb 25 06:01:07 IST 2016,"@TonyTrovato Feel the burn, Bernie."
JMorrison39,Wed Feb 24 20:10:45 IST 2016,"Searched Columbus Crew in the gif finder and it found a majority of Terry Crews gifs, which is close."

JMorrison39,Wed Feb 24 19:27:08 IST 2016,"Turns out the GOP has them too, and a lot less, but they have to vote for whoever wins the state, so bonus points."
JMorrison39,Wed Feb 24 19:21:54 IST 2016,Poor Bernie already behind a couple hundred delegates because of them.
JMorrison39,Wed Feb 24 19:18:37 IST 2016,"Which sounds like the most democratic thing I've ever heard, and perfectly fitting for their party."
JMorrison39,Wed Feb 24 19:18:07 IST 2016,"So the Democrats have something called superdelegates, which allow them to vote for a candidate regardless of primary results."
JMorrison39,Sun Feb 21 06:26:58 IST 2016,Just spotted @TonyTrovato  https://t.co/T0aihrXYYZ
JMorrison39,Wed Feb 17 21:42:13 IST 2016,@smitchcd Very excited to have you covering the Crew!
JMorrison39,Tue Feb 16 23:56:35 IST 2016,This is just cruel üíî https://t.co/VJUoPwQcKK
JMorrison39,Sat Feb 13 21:03:09 IST 2016,"@TonyTrovato The local economy wouldn't mind as much as your checking account. Btw, how did you stumble across a Stoke City tweet. New fan?"
JMorrison39,Sat Feb 13 21:00:13 IST 2016,"@TonyTrovato I agree. The gov't should just tax winnings at a higher rate, they'll make significant money from it."
JMorrison39,Sat Feb 13 20:56:38 IST 2016,@TonyTrovato There are loads of teams with betting agencies as kit sponsors. The entire Scottish Premiership is sponsored by one.
JMorrison39,Tue Feb 09 23:19:51 IST 2016,The #Sens got a steal in Frattin. #CBJ brass once thought he was better to have on a team than Marian Gaborik. https://t.co/9uV5ciMW8X
JMorrison39,Mon Feb 08 08:53:36 IST 2016,Did the Papa Johns guy just sneak a kiss on Peyton Manning?

JMorrison39,Fri Feb 05 20:44:50 IST 2016,@KyleKn0ws He hasn't really been the same since the storm
JMorrison39,Fri Feb 05 20:42:54 IST 2016,@KyleKn0ws I thought he was your BFF? You aren't in the know?
JMorrison39,Fri Feb 05 20:42:13 IST 2016,@KyleKn0ws Digz?
JMorrison39,Thu Feb 04 03:11:52 IST 2016,@KC_Sparks23 @TonyTrovato Haha I think that's how Tony quit his job at the State
JMorrison39,Thu Feb 04 03:08:08 IST 2016,@TonyTrovato Iowans just weren't feelin it this year.
JMorrison39,Wed Feb 03 18:37:16 IST 2016,More exciting than national letter of intent day is roll up the rim is back at Tim Horton's!
JMorrison39,Wed Feb 03 18:25:36 IST 2016,It's national letter of intent day. Grown men getting exciting about kids playing football at a school they may or may not have attended.
JMorrison39,Wed Feb 03 18:22:57 IST 2016,"@TonyTrovato We just can't accept sure things, like the CBJ being bad every year."
JMorrison39,Mon Feb 01 03:14:41 IST 2016,"At this point I'd rather have a team of prospects and picks than vets who ""know how to win"". Then you can measure growth at least #CBJ"
JMorrison39,Mon Feb 01 03:08:53 IST 2016,"A 3 loss OSU team, fire the entire staff. CBJ miss the playoffs for the 13th time in 15 seasons, it's okay guys, we can get them next time!"
JMorrison39,Mon Feb 01 03:06:46 IST 2016,I wish CBJ fans would treat their team like like OSU fans treat theirs. It's called pride and there is nothing wrong with it.
JMorrison39,Mon Feb 01 02:55:43 IST 2016,Arace never afraid to tell it like it is. I love it. #CBJ  https://t.co/FXdbSQbB4v
JMorrison39,Wed Jan 27 07:38:13 IST 2016,@TonyTrovato I think PK wanted that PP
JMorrison39,Tue Jan 26 23:50:03 IST 2016,My dad promised me 16 years ago if the #CBJ won a playoff series I could get a dog ‚òπÔ∏è
JMorrison39,Tue Jan 26 22:30:00 IST 2016,@phildaddy90 Everyone is the best at something!
JMorrison39,Tue Jan 26 20:08:58 IST 2016,Gordie Howe's don't count unfortunately  https://t.co/sGVKD0nZpO
