gvan1234,Sat Feb 27 09:12:09 IST 2016,@PhoebeFeben Poor Nik and then by that time I wonder if Sam will have the info on Hayden

gvan1234,Sat Feb 27 09:07:29 IST 2016,"@PhoebeFeben yes she is, it will be interesting to find out what she has to say"
gvan1234,Sat Feb 27 09:04:53 IST 2016,@PhoebeFeben I am wondering what Helena left for both of them. As far as I know Liz isn't related to her so it was odd she would be there
gvan1234,Sat Feb 27 09:01:40 IST 2016,@PhoebeFeben always belong to 'Sam even if they divorced. She saw then what he would really do for her

gvan1234,Sat Feb 27 08:55:30 IST 2016,@PhoebeFeben I think with these writers it may possibly happen. I have always liked BH/KeMo scenes when they are decent to each other
gvan1234,Sat Feb 27 08:52:17 IST 2016,@PhoebeFeben redeeming her but they need to give her a story outside of always being the angst for Jason/Sam #tiresome

gvan1234,Sat Feb 27 08:46:15 IST 2016,@PhoebeFeben like he was giving her hope without even realizing it. I think when Sam arrives the message will be clear to her

gvan1234,Sat Feb 27 08:37:54 IST 2016,@PhoebeFeben LOL! my thoughts exactly
gvan1234,Sat Feb 27 08:34:59 IST 2016,@PhoebeFeben that site is slanted so I don't take much stock in how they word things especially about Sam
