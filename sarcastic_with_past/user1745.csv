kshen,Mon Feb 29 10:12:03 IST 2016,@ApplebyHoratio yeah it's a hugely annoying and offensive stereotype that we're pretty sick of hearing.
kshen,Mon Feb 29 10:08:46 IST 2016,@ApplebyHoratio Making a joke about little yellow people with small dongs is the age old racist stereotype against Asian men.

kshen,Mon Feb 29 10:04:39 IST 2016,Thanks AliG for your casual racism propagating/making jokes about Asian stereotypes. #DiversityDoesntIncludeAsians #HollywoodRaceHierarchy
