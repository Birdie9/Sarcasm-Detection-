No way. Really? #sarcasm"
katieversion2,Mon Feb 29 04:25:22 IST 2016,Sinuses have me feeling like garbage. So bed and youtube for me for the rest of the evening.
katieversion2,Mon Feb 29 02:44:49 IST 2016,"Dear sinuses,
Why?
Why you gotta be like this??
Ow."
katieversion2,Sun Feb 28 23:17:46 IST 2016,"Hangover checklist:
Breakfast ✔
Tea ✔
Shower ✔
Gatorade ✔

Ok, I feel mostly human again."
katieversion2,Sun Feb 28 21:05:10 IST 2016,I should probably go outside at some point today because apparently it's really nice out.
katieversion2,Sun Feb 28 19:32:56 IST 2016,I'm up! And I feel ok!! Must've been that gatorade i downed at 6am. :)

katieversion2,Sun Feb 28 00:52:06 IST 2016,It was definitely when Mulder left.
katieversion2,Sun Feb 28 00:08:43 IST 2016,Since the middle of season 8 I've been trying to figure out when exactly the X-Files jumped the shark. Maybe when they introduced Doggett?
katieversion2,Sat Feb 27 23:55:25 IST 2016,@liveactionfloyd if your credit card is through your bank and you've already changed it at your bank (w certificate) then no proof needed.
katieversion2,Fri Feb 26 16:44:37 IST 2016,@HfxRankin it's a bit counterintuitive. You would think less processing meant lower prices.
katieversion2,Fri Feb 26 16:40:41 IST 2016,Listening to Kid A this morning. The make-or-break album for Radiohead fans everywhere.
katieversion2,Fri Feb 26 05:37:46 IST 2016,"@sack_vegas @HalifaxReTales Also, it takes forever to get there from home. :)"
katieversion2,Fri Feb 26 05:37:00 IST 2016,@sack_vegas @HalifaxReTales Ah yes. I also hate Bayer's Lake but it's because I have no car and it's a pedestrian nightmare!

katieversion2,Thu Feb 25 19:31:18 IST 2016,@brianlarter if I don't feed him when I get home he pesters me until I feed him. Yesterday I got home early and fed him. Big mistake.
katieversion2,Thu Feb 25 16:21:48 IST 2016,Note to self: if you feed the cat an hour earlier in the evening then he'll think he's starving to death an hour earlier in the morning.
katieversion2,Wed Feb 24 17:26:44 IST 2016,@EastCoastKnits I agree. But if I want to get to work before traffic gets crazy....
katieversion2,Wed Feb 24 17:25:16 IST 2016,@EastCoastKnits too late for that one. For me at least. I've already been up 2 hours. :/

katieversion2,Mon Feb 22 06:02:34 IST 2016,@labradorrose it's happened to me with entire bands before. I just didn't get it until I saw them live and it just clicked.
katieversion2,Mon Feb 22 05:59:05 IST 2016,@labradorrose I love it when that happens. Sometimes I don't realize how much a song means to me until I see it live. :)
katieversion2,Mon Feb 22 04:23:55 IST 2016,@EastCoastKnits it doesn't take many more to up the percentage is what I'm saying.
katieversion2,Mon Feb 22 04:17:08 IST 2016,@EastCoastKnits actually they've hired more men recently. I guess it's more like 75 now. But we're only 40 employees so...
katieversion2,Mon Feb 22 04:15:21 IST 2016,"@EastCoastKnits We're 90% women so, yes."
katieversion2,Mon Feb 22 02:53:59 IST 2016,"@EastCoastKnits awesome. Just seems like there's more thai, sushi and burger places than you can shake a stick at but not indian."
katieversion2,Mon Feb 22 02:52:01 IST 2016,@EastCoastKnits cool. I'll have to check one out sometime. I love indian food.
katieversion2,Mon Feb 22 02:50:52 IST 2016,OMG YOU GUYS...Aladdin is on CBC!!! I haven't seen it since the 90s!
katieversion2,Mon Feb 22 02:48:17 IST 2016,@EastCoastKnits there's a serious lack of indian food in the hrm! I can think of two or three places maybe.
katieversion2,Sun Feb 21 01:32:45 IST 2016,@hellafax hahah. Yeah I only run it when I'm home for that reason.
katieversion2,Sun Feb 21 00:09:47 IST 2016,Did I ever mention how much I love my roomba?
