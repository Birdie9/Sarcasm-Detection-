veryhotfish,Tue Dec 01 15:08:37 IST 2015,Being sarcastic in all of my #online #dating #profiles without actually saying I am #sarcastic. Of course the sarcastic fucks don't get it.
veryhotfish,Tue Dec 01 14:57:46 IST 2015,So you are 42 years old and identify yourself as a thug. Good deal. #datingtips.

veryhotfish,Tue Dec 01 12:34:33 IST 2015,"Guys, ""your profile is interesting"" or anything thereabouts = #boring. #datingtips"
veryhotfish,Tue Dec 01 12:33:08 IST 2015,"""You have an interesting profile"" This is getting so tiring."
veryhotfish,Tue Dec 01 12:32:25 IST 2015,LOL I like how #okcupid is now limiting how many visitors to your profile you can see unless you are a A-List.
veryhotfish,Tue Dec 01 12:25:38 IST 2015,"Hot dude who is ""drug-friendly."" What a waste."
veryhotfish,Tue Dec 01 11:24:57 IST 2015,So #OKCupid has revamped the site again? #shocking.
veryhotfish,Tue Dec 01 11:15:22 IST 2015,@Prisqua correct
veryhotfish,Tue Dec 01 11:02:57 IST 2015,"Dude. I wouldn't tick ""muscular"" as body type if I were you but okay. *snickers*"

veryhotfish,Tue Dec 01 10:45:22 IST 2015,Should I tell his fam he is really not interested in Auburn VS Alabama or UGA or wtfe else? I should. Yes.
veryhotfish,Tue Dec 01 10:44:31 IST 2015,I find it really amusing that H gets annoyed whenever he gets a phone call re: #American football games he is supposed to be watching.

veryhotfish,Tue Dec 01 10:26:44 IST 2015,I should mention this in passing to her or H's sister. It would be fucking hilarious.
veryhotfish,Tue Dec 01 10:25:23 IST 2015,I now just LOL every time H's mother calls when Auburn VS Alabama game is on. Becos H is either watching football or X-games.

veryhotfish,Tue Dec 01 09:05:16 IST 2015,I am REALLY #curious. #WHY do chicks wear workout clothes when they are obviously not en route to gym or even coming from the gym?
veryhotfish,Tue Dec 01 09:03:51 IST 2015,I hope you are not paying too much for #timewarnercable service @GodfatherScooby
