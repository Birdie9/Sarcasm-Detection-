MagicalSaint,Mon May 25 09:18:19 IST 2015,"@MrSwey22 nah, his on the court performance is why he's probably top 5. The over dramatics to wins, losses and simple plays is just too much"
MagicalSaint,Mon May 25 09:06:59 IST 2015,"Two Conference finals sweep??? Nah, son. David Stern woud have never let that shit happen."
MagicalSaint,Mon May 25 09:05:43 IST 2015,Lebron is an Awesome basketball player. But he gotta stop searching for a super nice things to say and stop being a Drama queen. MAN UP son!

MagicalSaint,Sun May 24 09:38:34 IST 2015,"@MagicMarkee Yep, that song went hard. I' just listened to it. Seems like the Pack was better than solo Lil B"
MagicalSaint,Sun May 24 09:35:45 IST 2015,Can't believe this Lil B/Pack song like 5 years old n shit. I thought this Lil B cat was some type new artist.

MagicalSaint,Sun May 24 09:05:39 IST 2015,"Steph Curry owns the the Southwest division. If Lebron had to play 3 teams from the Southwest Div to reach the Finals, He'll fail for sure"
MagicalSaint,Sun May 24 09:03:08 IST 2015,I would have rather see the Rockets lose game 6 of the 2nd round than get swept in the WCF.
MagicalSaint,Sun May 24 08:59:27 IST 2015,Olajuwon must be rolling over in his grave
MagicalSaint,Sun May 24 08:52:17 IST 2015,I just know Dwight gonna get himself ejected in game 4. His big pussy is so predictable

MagicalSaint,Sat May 23 08:52:03 IST 2015,Kobe &Jordan never made a finals w/o Phil Jackson. Tim Duncan never made a finals without Pop. Lebron taking 3 head coach's to the Finals
MagicalSaint,Sat May 23 08:48:41 IST 2015,Let me stroke the Lebron stans ego
MagicalSaint,Sat May 23 08:45:37 IST 2015,Is this the first time in @NBAHistory than there will be TWO Rookie Head Coaches in the @nba Finals?? @stevekylerNBA
MagicalSaint,Sat May 23 08:43:27 IST 2015,"Lebron took Mike Brown, Erik Spoelstra & now David Blatt to the Finals. There's no offense for Lebron teams i guess, just give him the ball"
