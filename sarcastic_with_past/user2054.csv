billtaylor985,Sun Feb 28 02:32:59 IST 2016,@JillianMcLeod05 The Leafs traded away your fave goalie and kept Bernier. Why do I have a feeling they'll immediately regret that decision?

billtaylor985,Sun Feb 28 02:23:10 IST 2016,"Ya know, I never got the whole point of goalie interference. You get penalized because the goalie can't see? Isn't that the point? #stlblues"
billtaylor985,Sun Feb 28 02:18:42 IST 2016,Just finished my latest Into the Cardinals Nest for this week. I ran a bit behind but still gettin it done. Should be on @cleatgeeks soon.

billtaylor985,Sat Feb 27 08:48:38 IST 2016,@TrueToTheLou72 LMAO!! Made my night sir. Thank u for that one.
billtaylor985,Sat Feb 27 08:46:22 IST 2016,@TrueToTheLou72 What I dislike is when you're single and u see everyone else talking about how they are the best couple since sliced bread
billtaylor985,Sat Feb 27 08:40:17 IST 2016,"@Kayluvsredwings good, I don't want it to. lol. They've got a few too many Cups already."
billtaylor985,Sat Feb 27 08:38:31 IST 2016,@SuperTwo_Sports I say Rocky IV but my favorite one was actually III. The reason Rocky IV was best is the fight with the Russian was epic.
billtaylor985,Sat Feb 27 08:35:18 IST 2016,"@Kayluvsredwings The way they're acquiring players from everybody, they ought to have the greatest team ever, love em or hate em."
billtaylor985,Sat Feb 27 08:31:42 IST 2016,@FoxNews @NomikiKonst I don't mean to be off topic here but did anyone else do a double take and think that was @katyperry for a sec? lol.
billtaylor985,Sat Feb 27 08:28:32 IST 2016,@cleatgeeks I should think so. We may be geeks but we're awesome geeks with awesome stories on just about everything else. Why not this? lol

billtaylor985,Sat Feb 27 01:26:24 IST 2016,@BleedinBlueFS What??? Why??
billtaylor985,Sat Feb 27 01:21:19 IST 2016,Hope everyone has a great day. Unplugged for the most part yesterday. I saw #OurBlues lost a tight one last night. We'll get it back. :)
billtaylor985,Sat Feb 27 01:17:49 IST 2016,@EricLevitsky @ginisimov Now she has..unfortumately..all I said was that she looked awesome. No implication intended..
billtaylor985,Thu Feb 25 20:38:24 IST 2016,@stlcards_fanly He'll be  the new Villanueva
billtaylor985,Thu Feb 25 09:32:07 IST 2016,"@Brilabu_ Yeah. Problem is it's Taker, and he's..well...Shane McMahon. I like Shane O but his chances are up crap creek and he has no paddle"
billtaylor985,Thu Feb 25 09:29:37 IST 2016,@galaxyyglue Call em and let em know you're still out.
billtaylor985,Thu Feb 25 09:28:16 IST 2016,"@alexiszotos You'd think someone in management would be made aware of that. That should be #1 on the checklist for ""It's OK to live here."""
billtaylor985,Thu Feb 25 09:23:19 IST 2016,@HTC_Brittan @HTC_Speaker @TexansCheer  You're a pretty and awesome #goodluckcharm..
billtaylor985,Thu Feb 25 09:20:57 IST 2016,I've thought up a brilliant idea for the next Into the Cardinals Nest. You guys'll have to wait a bit longer but it'll be worth it.#stlcards
billtaylor985,Thu Feb 25 09:16:35 IST 2016,@ginisimov @EricLevitsky Lovely look for u.
billtaylor985,Thu Feb 25 09:02:48 IST 2016,"@LarryLambert6 If I may be honest, both CHI teams made out like a bandit. I'd love to see the Sox in the series vs the Cards. #fresh"
billtaylor985,Thu Feb 25 08:22:24 IST 2016,"@Brilabu_ No way the match sticks as is. Cena will pull off one of his magic tricks and replace Shane-O, and then proceed to win the match."
billtaylor985,Thu Feb 25 08:14:19 IST 2016,@atsf101 @AngellaSharpe Nice pic. How did Angella get back from Hawaii so fast? #globetrotter
billtaylor985,Thu Feb 25 08:10:55 IST 2016,@SARAYKO55 Burn the oil and get er done. You'll hate it in the morning especially if it's an essay. Believe me.

billtaylor985,Thu Feb 25 07:36:00 IST 2016,"@FishSTL @Rachel__Nichols She's one of my faves too. I like sports ladies. Breaking barriers, kickin butts and takin names. :)"
billtaylor985,Thu Feb 25 07:22:07 IST 2016,@alexiszotos Stay warm. :)  You could be a popsicle yourself
billtaylor985,Thu Feb 25 07:16:35 IST 2016,@RB_314 I've clearly gone off the rails. lol.
billtaylor985,Thu Feb 25 07:15:05 IST 2016,"@RB_314 My reaction to this exactly. I was laughing my ass off when I saw this. Believe me, I wish I were trolling. lol"
billtaylor985,Thu Feb 25 07:11:06 IST 2016,@DizzyDean_17 @FoxNews *cue him running the other direction in a hurry
billtaylor985,Thu Feb 25 07:10:14 IST 2016,@DizzyDean_17 I understand where the fiancee is coming from. Nobody would take them serious if they were asked what their full names were.
billtaylor985,Thu Feb 25 07:05:42 IST 2016,There are some things in life u just can't make up.. LMAO #crazynews https://t.co/fv884pW10y
billtaylor985,Thu Feb 25 03:32:03 IST 2016,@SamSPN13  Those were all great.  I forgot  I also liked the Good Burger skits. They were funny in a corny way.
billtaylor985,Thu Feb 25 03:28:01 IST 2016,@SamSPN13 never seen Game Changers. Last show I liked on Nick was Hey Arnold!! Didn't care for much else.

billtaylor985,Thu Feb 25 03:15:22 IST 2016,@SamSPN13 It's trying to be Disney Channel and failing miserably. One of the reasons I miss the 90's when there wasn't kid sitcom bull on.
billtaylor985,Thu Feb 25 03:08:52 IST 2016,@BillyHamilton cue fangirl squee. lol #kidding Can't wait to see my team play you and the @Reds again this season.
billtaylor985,Thu Feb 25 03:04:10 IST 2016,@Kayluvsredwings I get what he's trying to do and I empathize but it's not gonna work. This generation's not gonna have it. #entitled
billtaylor985,Thu Feb 25 02:56:08 IST 2016,"@Kayluvsredwings As much as Mr. O ran America into the ground, Trump is a bit meh. Can't respect a man who has a tantrum every time he loses"
