pswright80,Sun Feb 28 08:34:16 IST 2016,@PerthWildcats I haven't had enough sms'd reminding me today - would one ever ten minutes be better #sarcasm #onceisenough
pswright80,Fri Feb 26 18:43:51 IST 2016,The fact you're sending me a sms defeats the purpose of a spoiler alert @PerthWildcats - you don't sms us after a series loss
pswright80,Fri Feb 26 18:21:25 IST 2016,Least AJ made a poster - good on him!

pswright80,Thu Feb 25 12:36:18 IST 2016,@Andthefoulnet only takes 40 mins to change it. Perth even in game 1 didn't look great - slightly concerning being a Cats fan
pswright80,Thu Feb 25 12:24:06 IST 2016,@Andthefoulnet the Hawks to end the Perth drought tomorrow
pswright80,Wed Feb 24 06:54:13 IST 2016,@fastathenbarcia @Andthefoulnet @PerthWildcats why is JC blocking Wotto's shot üòù
pswright80,Wed Feb 24 06:52:31 IST 2016,@Andthefoulnet @PerthWildcats JC for me - he was the man when the Cats started this run of 30 years. Grace a very close second then Vlahov

pswright80,Mon Feb 22 04:04:40 IST 2016,@straightbreaks as predicted
pswright80,Sun Feb 21 19:31:06 IST 2016,@straightbreaks we've been playing very well. Coming back from playing in Italy Thursday though. Decent team named though.
pswright80,Sun Feb 21 19:24:46 IST 2016,@straightbreaks my boys are on in an hour. I'm expecting Spurs to come back to traditional form and stuff things up at some point
pswright80,Sun Feb 21 19:17:24 IST 2016,@straightbreaks @ReadingFC great result for them
pswright80,Sun Feb 21 18:37:40 IST 2016,@straightbreaks @TSBible thats straight out of the Man Utd play book

pswright80,Wed Feb 17 16:20:23 IST 2016,Big congrats to @kevinlisch on his second MVP award #welldeserved
pswright80,Wed Feb 17 13:20:55 IST 2016,@CJKRobinson in a few weeks I'll be controversial and say Jesse Wagstaff is the Cats MVP for this season.

pswright80,Wed Feb 17 06:47:43 IST 2016,@PerthWildcats can I confirm we use our season tickets for entry into finals games?
pswright80,Tue Feb 16 04:30:56 IST 2016,@mrpford it was like 100000% clear you referenced his mental health issues as what had been going on for years when I heard you on @6PR

pswright80,Wed Feb 10 18:04:48 IST 2016,@Kumbiland I want to try the Malaysian GP now it's been moved to non monsoon season. It's so much cheaper
pswright80,Wed Feb 10 09:19:05 IST 2016,@6PRSportsToday shame the play doesn't resemble that of the group from two years ago!
pswright80,Wed Feb 10 04:34:53 IST 2016,@Kumbiland I need to get back there one year

pswright80,Wed Feb 03 11:59:33 IST 2016,@Kuytstanding if I'm in Bali I'm only drinking the local brew of which there's what two to choose from ???
pswright80,Wed Feb 03 11:48:22 IST 2016,@Kuytstanding same for London. Ain't no Londoners left there which is a shame.
pswright80,Wed Feb 03 11:46:58 IST 2016,@Kuytstanding I found a nice one next to our hotel near the Marriott
pswright80,Wed Feb 03 11:46:29 IST 2016,@Kuytstanding isn't all of Australian media trying that. I'll still go there but to find the real Bali you need to venture out a lot more
pswright80,Wed Feb 03 11:43:32 IST 2016,"@Kuytstanding Im agreeing that some elements that made Bali - ""Bali"" are being lost due to the over modernisation"
pswright80,Wed Feb 03 10:09:47 IST 2016,Agree with @Percyqc I've been going to Bali for the past 5 years and I've seen a massive change #sadtosee #bringbackbali

pswright80,Sat Jan 30 20:03:30 IST 2016,@Kuytstanding @PerthWildcats with the level of effort displayed in OT they should have saved themselves LOL
pswright80,Sat Jan 30 20:00:41 IST 2016,@Kuytstanding @PerthWildcats watch the replay. Very clearly said in a time out with 4 that cats couldn't win -he had basically conceded.
pswright80,Sat Jan 30 19:59:41 IST 2016,@Kuytstanding well we've scored 4 #lightside
pswright80,Sat Jan 30 19:58:16 IST 2016,@Kuytstanding @PerthWildcats - now to hear the Cats are pissed at Gleeson giving up with 4 mins to go in reg. and everything will be ace
pswright80,Sat Jan 30 19:55:34 IST 2016,@Kuytstanding @PerthWildcats being back 48mins as well - fiba has destroyed the game
pswright80,Sat Jan 30 16:45:50 IST 2016,Massive start from the @PerthGloryFC 2 goals in about 90 secs
pswright80,Sat Jan 30 16:34:28 IST 2016,Can the possession arrow somehow be put on the scoreboard @PerthWildcats.
pswright80,Fri Jan 29 15:54:03 IST 2016,@Kuytstanding @Lachy_Reid welcome Callum
