Clantastic,Mon Feb 29 04:04:33 IST 2016,"@Wanyamas_bicep I enjoy beating any Erhardt, they've had 4 years of more ""big games"" while we've been life support for Hull, Edinburgh etc.."

Clantastic,Mon Feb 29 01:50:44 IST 2016,@Poppet_panther both
Clantastic,Mon Feb 29 01:24:14 IST 2016,"Clan worth their lead at the end of the 2nd.
Panthers lacking discipline and Janssen now missing definitely having an adverse effect."
Clantastic,Mon Feb 29 01:08:49 IST 2016,"Different game without Janssen, Panthers look rattled & our players don't have to have eyes in the back of their heads.."
Clantastic,Mon Feb 29 01:03:49 IST 2016,"@Poppet_panther penalised for checking to the head, ""legal"" or ""clean"" it wasn't on this occasion"
Clantastic,Mon Feb 29 01:03:21 IST 2016,"Panthers players losing the plot here..shame

Clantastic,Mon Feb 29 00:44:11 IST 2016,"Janssen tried to put McIver out for a few weeks this time.
Not quite the same result thankfully."

Clantastic,Sun Feb 28 18:02:41 IST 2016,".@Simmsey on Periscope..?
Quick, grab your EIHL social media guidelines everyone !"
Clantastic,Sun Feb 28 17:59:29 IST 2016,@fud72 agree but hopefully by post-season we'll be ready to take on anyone and everyone
Clantastic,Sun Feb 28 17:53:42 IST 2016,"@fud72 I couldn't care less about the Conference title, 2nd seeding handy but we know better than anyone it comes with no guarantees"
Clantastic,Sun Feb 28 17:42:05 IST 2016,"@fud72 not happy, but performance is back on an upward curve.
According to my scientific calculations we should peak around 2nd/3rd of April"
Clantastic,Sun Feb 28 17:25:26 IST 2016,"Who's best team to end your slump against ? 
The one that puts our captain out for weeks, that makes Checking It Out & claims a ""Grand Slam"""

Clantastic,Sun Feb 28 03:57:50 IST 2016,"A loss but significantly better performance tonight. Good to have Pitt & Keith back & props to McIver, fight with Keefe energised the crowd"
Clantastic,Sun Feb 28 03:47:32 IST 2016,"A proper ""choke"" in the sense we were getting hit with, you first must be leading.
