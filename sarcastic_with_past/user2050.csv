pep30,Sun Feb 28 03:07:33 IST 2016,"Imagine that, a NSH PP here...at least that call was on an actual penalty, Shatty to the box for a trip #STLBlues"
pep30,Sun Feb 28 03:06:31 IST 2016,At least this atrocity is happening before Monday's #NHL #TradeDeadline... #STLBlues
pep30,Sun Feb 28 03:05:03 IST 2016,"Blues fans working on a good ref you suck chant at Bridgestone Arena, at least they are showing heart #STLBlues"
pep30,Sun Feb 28 03:04:25 IST 2016,Even Panger is baffled at these refs #STLBlues #ThatsSayingSomething
pep30,Sun Feb 28 03:03:58 IST 2016,"RT @KingDonutI: Wwwwwwwwow, these officials."
pep30,Sun Feb 28 03:03:38 IST 2016,"RT @jprutherford: Ellis cross-checked Schwartz in the wall. No call, so Backes goes after Ellis. Schwartz shaken up, Barile out to see him."
pep30,Sun Feb 28 03:02:45 IST 2016,Another interesting non call there as Schwartz goes into the board hard on a hit from behind #STLBlues
pep30,Sun Feb 28 02:57:08 IST 2016,"RT @TheSweaternotes: Hopefully? Man, they're playing like a group of mentally whipped novices.  https://t.co/jpwNroR3ps"
pep30,Sun Feb 28 02:54:48 IST 2016,I'm sick of seeing uninspired uncommitted play from this team...we NEED an on & off ice leadership change ASAP...
pep30,Sun Feb 28 02:50:52 IST 2016,Hopefully the Note start taking away NSH time & space soon so they can stop the bleeding & claw back in to this one. #STLBlues
pep30,Sun Feb 28 02:48:30 IST 2016,"After that weak G, that makes it 3-0 NSH, we may see Copley soon #STLBlues"
pep30,Sun Feb 28 02:45:03 IST 2016,Shatty to the box for a hook now after he telegraphed a pass to Rinne to make it easy for him to save the one timer... #STLBlues
pep30,Sun Feb 28 02:42:58 IST 2016,"Welp, another slow start to a per for #OurBlues sees NSH increase their lead to 2-0 after the puck bounces off a Ds skate backdoor #STLBlues"
pep30,Sun Feb 28 02:22:47 IST 2016,"End of 1 and its 1-0 Preds, who have gotten help from the refs..shots are 15-9 bad guys #STLBlues"
pep30,Sun Feb 28 02:18:44 IST 2016,How is that a penalty on the Note and not the Preds?? Backes was basically molested in front... #STLBlues #RefsYouSuck
pep30,Sun Feb 28 02:15:59 IST 2016,"NSH seems to be a lot more grotty than the Blues, you don't see that very often #STLBlues"
pep30,Sun Feb 28 02:10:56 IST 2016,"Stastny looked like he didn't want to score on that chance...and good thing Allen showed up, great lateral movement so far #STLBlues"
pep30,Sun Feb 28 02:06:46 IST 2016,The refs are really treating this contest like a playoff game. Good to see but could get very chippy by its end #STLBlues
pep30,Sun Feb 28 02:01:43 IST 2016,The Note need to match NSH intensity to get back in this one. 1-0 Preds early though Allen looks good so far. #STLBlues
pep30,Sat Feb 27 22:56:03 IST 2016,"Lundstrom for Nilsson, interesting depth move in goal for #OurBlues. We're now even more stacked in net. #TradeDeadline #STLBlues"

pep30,Sat Feb 27 02:07:00 IST 2016,RT @TSNBobMcKenzie: Sounds like Christian Ehrhoff will be moving from LA to CHI. Not an official trade but likely to occur. #TSN #tradecent…
pep30,Sat Feb 27 01:58:53 IST 2016,True but the salary was inflated from the start due to market conditions. He's only a little behind his career avgs https://t.co/cXqPLbl3Nm
pep30,Sat Feb 27 01:23:11 IST 2016,"Yep, goaltending is definitely not #OurBlues problem. #MOOSE #SNAKE #STLBlues https://t.co/OEEuCnaPHs"

pep30,Fri Feb 26 23:55:12 IST 2016,"Allen turned away 21 of 23 NYR shots last night. He's allowed 2 or fewer Gs in 8/9 home starts (1.7GAA, .932SV%, 1SO) #STLBlues #SNAKE"
pep30,Fri Feb 26 22:56:37 IST 2016,"@bluenotebacker I hope so as well, but don't hold your breath, he's only about a .25PPG play in the playoffs (Oshie was .3 at least lol)"
pep30,Fri Feb 26 22:51:08 IST 2016,Brouwer scored his 12th G last night (3rd on the PP). Let's hope that leads to him heating up #STLBlues https://t.co/NTwK9CTHKs

pep30,Fri Feb 26 05:50:07 IST 2016,"Allen has only played in 1 game v NYR, & it was poor (3GA on 5 shots in 15 min). He'll be extra focused ton to avenge that #STLBlues #SNAKE"
