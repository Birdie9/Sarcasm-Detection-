AYDAN05MANNING,Tue Feb 23 01:44:04 IST 2016,Listening to Andrew McCutchen cry about the wildcard play in game is pretty pathetic. Sounds like a Yinzer.

AYDAN05MANNING,Thu Feb 18 09:44:28 IST 2016,@UNC_Basketball isn't odd Roy basically said in half time interview he doesn't care about defense?? Reason 1 they lose all these close games
AYDAN05MANNING,Thu Feb 18 09:41:24 IST 2016,@BenBrower15 @Brower4 it has showed all year in the losses. Close games they can't stop me and you.
