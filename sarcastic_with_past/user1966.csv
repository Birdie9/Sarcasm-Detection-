PrinceOberyn1,Sun Feb 28 07:49:55 IST 2016,"@sfloridastorm @amandacarpenter You have two weeks left, it will be statistically over March 15 if the individual state polls are correct"
PrinceOberyn1,Sun Feb 28 07:03:35 IST 2016,@RealBenCarson The next Surgeon General of the Unites States
PrinceOberyn1,Sun Feb 28 05:47:33 IST 2016,"@marcorubio Every high profile politician in SC backed you to, didnt help much."
PrinceOberyn1,Sun Feb 28 05:42:23 IST 2016,"@KarlRove Screw the GOP,  there's a new sheriff in town and he doesn't answer to you political hacks."
PrinceOberyn1,Sat Feb 27 23:57:35 IST 2016,@tedcruz @betsy_klein Let me get this straight. You cant beat Trump but we should chose you to run in general? Makes sense
PrinceOberyn1,Sat Feb 27 11:32:58 IST 2016,"@MichaelCBender @realDonaldTrump Do another fundraiser instead, Fox is in the can for Rubio. Nothing to gain."
PrinceOberyn1,Sat Feb 27 11:29:04 IST 2016,"@realDonaldTrump Screw the debates, if you win super Tuesday I would say screw it and not do them. Nothing to gain from doing them"
PrinceOberyn1,Sat Feb 27 11:26:26 IST 2016,@MichaelCBender 10 debates. If you still dont know what your candidate stands for you are a fucking fool. Enough of the debates already.
PrinceOberyn1,Sat Feb 27 10:02:47 IST 2016,"@marcorubio I live in VA, I can guarantee nobody gives a shit about you in this state."
PrinceOberyn1,Sat Feb 27 09:56:51 IST 2016,"@Iyrichie How bout you die, but before you do so .....blow me"
PrinceOberyn1,Sat Feb 27 08:06:02 IST 2016,@marcorubio 3 states you have no shot at winning. Better spend your money in Florida. You lose there its bye bye
PrinceOberyn1,Sat Feb 27 06:25:07 IST 2016,@tedcruz @brendanponton Look for Trump to take at least 9 states Tuesday. March 15 will be nail in coffin for that weasel Rubio in Fla.
PrinceOberyn1,Sat Feb 27 00:09:39 IST 2016,@BillKristol Yes because we know how accurate your predictions have been the past 6 months
PrinceOberyn1,Fri Feb 26 20:07:24 IST 2016,"@lancesimmens Wow, a month ago you claimed Trump had no chance. You finally see the light"
PrinceOberyn1,Fri Feb 26 11:31:00 IST 2016,@realDonaldTrump Can't wait till Tuesday to cast my first ever vote for Donald Trump in Virginia. Along with my wife and son. All first time
PrinceOberyn1,Fri Feb 26 10:56:44 IST 2016,@nikkihaley @marcorubio Too bad your own state rejected you and Rubio
PrinceOberyn1,Fri Feb 26 10:19:59 IST 2016,"@MittRomney @realDonaldTrump Mitt your weak, you allowed Harry Reid to bully you into releasing taxes. Go away."
PrinceOberyn1,Fri Feb 26 09:48:12 IST 2016,@carrierushing He gives everyone a interview. Free advertising. Spent less then anyone in race and winning.
PrinceOberyn1,Fri Feb 26 09:41:17 IST 2016,@KarlRove You cant build all the way across southern border because of natural barriers.
PrinceOberyn1,Fri Feb 26 08:52:26 IST 2016,@carrierushing @realDonaldTrump Is it an insult if its true? He does have some of the worst ratings on talk radio.
PrinceOberyn1,Fri Feb 26 02:33:27 IST 2016,@amandacarpenter All the guys you mentioned have one thing in common. Losers in the GOP primaries. LOL
PrinceOberyn1,Fri Feb 26 02:17:05 IST 2016,@MittRomney You tried to be funny and made yourself look like a ass. You want Trump taxes but they had to twist your arm to get yours.
PrinceOberyn1,Fri Feb 26 01:53:01 IST 2016,"@ajp1753 @IngrahamAngle Why Because you said so? Not legally required, supporters don care."
PrinceOberyn1,Fri Feb 26 01:51:41 IST 2016,"@IngrahamAngle Over 80,000 voted absentee when Jeb was still in. Not good for Rubio."
PrinceOberyn1,Thu Feb 25 10:14:23 IST 2016,"@realDonaldTrump @ahernandez85a I'm voting based on your policies, dont care about your personal tax returns. Screw the main stream media."
PrinceOberyn1,Thu Feb 25 10:01:55 IST 2016,@realDonaldTrump @ahernandez85a Give them the middle finger and dont release taxes. General public only cares how you will run country.
PrinceOberyn1,Thu Feb 25 05:53:56 IST 2016,"@realDonaldTrump There is no legal requirement to release tax returns. Dont release them, Rubio and Cruz didnt. Only media cares, screw them"
PrinceOberyn1,Wed Feb 24 17:57:04 IST 2016,"@MadisonSiriusXM @gtusmc05_day Hey Madison do your research, 12 million people deported during Clinton's 8 years in office. Can be done"
PrinceOberyn1,Wed Feb 24 07:58:20 IST 2016,@MarcACaputo @amandacarpenter Get rid of these stupid caucuses already

PrinceOberyn1,Wed Feb 24 07:00:35 IST 2016,@AaronBlake @amandacarpenter He's pandering to the blacks in SC because Hillary has 80% of black vote against Sanders
PrinceOberyn1,Wed Feb 24 06:35:30 IST 2016,"@ColumbiaBugle @amandacarpenter They have been campaigning for 6 months, how much more do you need to here to make a decision?"
PrinceOberyn1,Wed Feb 24 05:32:40 IST 2016,@TheLeadCNN @amandacarpenter @DanaBashCNN @VanJones68 Its not Carson's job to help Cruz get votes.
PrinceOberyn1,Wed Feb 24 05:27:10 IST 2016,"@vjeannek @amandacarpenter @politico Stone, ""The Committee To Restore America's Greatness"""
PrinceOberyn1,Wed Feb 24 05:23:31 IST 2016,@vjeannek @amandacarpenter @politico He created a super pac for Trump to attack Clinton if he gets the nomination
PrinceOberyn1,Wed Feb 24 05:17:38 IST 2016,@glennbeck @tedcruz Will you be with Cruz onstage during his concession speech?
PrinceOberyn1,Wed Feb 24 05:07:20 IST 2016,@amandacarpenter Write ins are for whiny crybabies who are mad their candidate didnt win
PrinceOberyn1,Tue Feb 23 11:30:12 IST 2016,"@realDonaldTrump These phone polls dont include me or my wife, will be voting for first time in VA next week for Trump."
PrinceOberyn1,Tue Feb 23 08:28:17 IST 2016,@theblaze You left out detail it was scheduled last minute and Trump already had two events scheduled in VA and NY. Megyn even confirmed it.
PrinceOberyn1,Tue Feb 23 08:21:17 IST 2016,@theblaze @megynkelly Based on the networks ratings nobody will see it
PrinceOberyn1,Tue Feb 23 07:16:55 IST 2016,"@youzoob @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump @marcorubio LOL  chinese built  5,500 mile wall without  heavy machinery tech. Were talking only 1100"
PrinceOberyn1,Tue Feb 23 02:43:28 IST 2016,"@HawkinsUSA @jimgeraghty @elianayjohnson He's not dropping, already said  strategy is to stay in and see what happens in Michigan and Ohio"
PrinceOberyn1,Tue Feb 23 02:33:47 IST 2016,@NateSilver538 No surprise considering western states have lots of hispanics.
PrinceOberyn1,Mon Feb 22 08:13:28 IST 2016,@secupp Will the quiz show be on a regular basis or one time deal?
PrinceOberyn1,Mon Feb 22 05:28:25 IST 2016,@dmc2et @lilrascal01 @KatyTurNBC Those polls also dont show all the new voters that have been coming out or crossing over
PrinceOberyn1,Mon Feb 22 05:13:42 IST 2016,@dmc2et @lilrascal01 @KatyTurNBC I guess that means 80% dont want Cruz or Rubio
PrinceOberyn1,Mon Feb 22 03:03:07 IST 2016,"@PennsCurse @carrierushing @tedcruz You dont have to pander, but you wont win general with just conservatives"
PrinceOberyn1,Mon Feb 22 02:58:52 IST 2016,@carrierushing @tedcruz So what your saying is no crossover appeal? Not good in general election.
