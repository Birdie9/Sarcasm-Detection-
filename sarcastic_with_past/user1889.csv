AndyResnik,Mon Feb 29 00:10:51 IST 2016,"You know what, Blatt was clearly the problem. It had nothing to do with the Cavs players. #sarcasm"
AndyResnik,Mon Feb 29 00:09:27 IST 2016,@indiansplayoffs I imagine I'll be turning it off by halftime. This team is gutless.
AndyResnik,Mon Feb 29 00:07:55 IST 2016,"@monday40 They're going to be playing Toronto without home court, and at this moment the Raptors are better."
AndyResnik,Mon Feb 29 00:05:25 IST 2016,"I'm sorry, but there's no way this Cavs team can win it all. I guess they have time to figure it out, but they won't."
AndyResnik,Sun Feb 28 23:58:36 IST 2016,The Cavs can't freaking shoot or defend in transition. I hate this team. I really and truly hate it.
AndyResnik,Sun Feb 28 23:04:04 IST 2016,@Josie614 Congrats! I was figuring on Omar.
AndyResnik,Sun Feb 28 22:55:37 IST 2016,"When the Cavs have to win Game 7 of the ECF in Toronto, I hope LeBron realizes all the crap he has done wrong this year."

AndyResnik,Sun Feb 28 22:23:19 IST 2016,@HipsterTito I'm now at that point. It's never going to happen.
AndyResnik,Sun Feb 28 21:55:01 IST 2016,"After Indians lost 1995 World Series and after Cavs lost 2007 Finals, I actually thought a title was only a matter of time. Man, I'm dumb."
AndyResnik,Sun Feb 28 21:53:15 IST 2016,"When LeBron came back, I never thought a Steph Curry injury would be the Cavs' best chance at a ring. Why did I forget I'm from Cleveland?"
AndyResnik,Sun Feb 28 21:49:40 IST 2016,"Although I won't be successful, today would be a good day to start avoiding the Cavs until April."
AndyResnik,Sun Feb 28 10:04:32 IST 2016,"@AlexRaffalli Life as a Cleveland fan, in all three sports. There's always someone or some team that's just a little better."
AndyResnik,Sun Feb 28 09:56:47 IST 2016,No way anyone is beating the Warriors four out of seven unless Curry gets hurt. So last night's Cavs loss meant nothing after all.
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 22:56:31 IST 2016,"LeBron loves to bitch at teammates and refs, but who calls him out for turnovers, iso offense and lazy D? No one. https://t.co/N2WyXIBOo9"
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 22:52:18 IST 2016,"The players also take their emotional cues from LeBron, they go as he goes, which shows what a terrible leader he is https://t.co/N2WyXIBOo9"
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 22:13:59 IST 2016,"@RyanInCLE I just tried that with his three tweets, and only part of the first one would translate."
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 22:12:52 IST 2016,"@RyanInCLE In Google, type ""translate"" and then copy and paste the tweet that's in Spanish."
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 20:51:41 IST 2016,"I'm still trying to wrap my head around last night's game. But once again, @JasonLloydABJ capsulizes Cavs perfectly. https://t.co/h4ScVQMR8k"
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 10:12:07 IST 2016,This made me smile after tonight's latest Cavs debacle. https://t.co/zWM6LXcXA3
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 09:34:55 IST 2016,I'm still baffled by that fourth quarter from the Cavs and this team in general. It's such a weird season.
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 09:17:34 IST 2016,Champions possess mental toughness and a determination to work together as a team for a common goal. I don't see those traits from the Cavs.
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 09:15:02 IST 2016,"@CLESportPrspctv How can a team led by LeBron James be mentally soft? Oh, that's right, it's because LeBron is a terrible leader."
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 09:13:30 IST 2016,@JohnArthurHutch I soured on them the moment they got Blatt fired. It doesn't feel like a team in the true sense of the word. They're babies
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 09:09:50 IST 2016,"@JohnArthurHutch As I tweeted a few minutes ago, I'm getting no enjoyment from this season. I don't like how they play or their attitudes."
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 09:05:13 IST 2016,"@JohnArthurHutch I'm 99.9 percent sure they won't win it. Last year, I was 99.9 percent sure they would."
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 08:59:14 IST 2016,I never thought I'd get so little enjoyment from a good Cleveland team. But that's how I feel about the Cavs. Only a title is acceptable.
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 08:51:29 IST 2016,"The Cavs will have to figure out a way to stop Lowry and beat Toronto in 6, because something tells me the Raptors will have home court."
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 08:43:26 IST 2016,I still can't believe the Cavs never had LeBron guard Lowry in the fourth quarter. Something is just off with this team.
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 08:42:26 IST 2016,"It took a ridiculous game from Lowry, ridiculous officiating and a major choke from the Cavs, but still, they never should have lost tonight"
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 08:38:53 IST 2016,"Awful loss for the Cavs, especially if they don't end up finishing first in the East. Plus, the Raptors just got a huge confidence boost."
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 08:33:04 IST 2016,"In the playoffs, LeBron is going to have to guard Lowry down the stretch. The Cavs guards can't stop him."
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 08:31:11 IST 2016,Terrible possession on defense and then offense with the game on the line.
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 08:18:54 IST 2016,"I'd say that Lowry is going to win this for the Raptors by himself, but the three refs are playing a role too."
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 08:17:08 IST 2016,The Cavs are coming unglued again.
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 08:14:27 IST 2016,The refs got a call right!
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 08:12:30 IST 2016,@AlexRaffalli This is one of those games where they're equally terrible for both teams. It's been really bad.
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 08:11:17 IST 2016,@AlexRaffalli Why would the refs start making correct calls now?
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 08:08:21 IST 2016,The refs have been making stuff up all night and they're probably going to decide this game.
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 08:04:55 IST 2016,This officiating is embarrassing.
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 08:01:10 IST 2016,It took the Cavs 90 seconds to come unglued.
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 07:59:15 IST 2016,Is part of the reason NBA refs are so bad is that they're so much shorter than most players and thus have trouble following some plays?
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 07:53:21 IST 2016,That will be a flagrant 1 on Delly because of Delly's reputation.
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 07:44:04 IST 2016,"The refs are so bad in this game tonight. Bad calls both ways, and a lot of them."
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 07:41:34 IST 2016,"@Gerbs81 I think Kyrie is still rebuilding the strength in that knee, which is why he isn't shooting as well."
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 07:39:49 IST 2016,Kyrie is off his game tonight. And the Cavs are up 12.
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 07:30:46 IST 2016,@HipsterTito Great play by Scola. There was no foul.
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 07:21:20 IST 2016,NBA officiating is terrible. Period.
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 07:09:29 IST 2016,"Sometimes, plus-minus is meaningless in the NBA. Tonight isn't one of those nights. LeBron is +16, Kyrie is -9."
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 06:57:59 IST 2016,@10CanBananaMilk @RealMYoung23 Started the second quarter with five bench players.
