ConfessionsINFJ,Tue Mar 31 00:14:40 IST 2015,Why do I feel a special connection with kids? Maybe it's the honesty. Gah. I can play with them for days. #INFJ #introvert

ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 21:27:05 IST 2015,@Hopevplatitudes well Taiwan is close enough :)))
ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 21:21:12 IST 2015,"@Hopevplatitudes no wonder I haven't heard of it. Philippines, somewhere in Asia. :)"
ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 21:17:09 IST 2015,@Hopevplatitudes great. Sounds fun! :)
ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 21:16:14 IST 2015,"@Hopevplatitudes haven't really heard of it here (my country), so thanks for the info! I like learning about new things. :)"
ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 21:07:25 IST 2015,"@Hopevplatitudes just to be clear, who uses the puppets in that case? The therapist or the group?"
ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 21:03:35 IST 2015,@Hopevplatitudes group session makes more sense! Excuse my ignorance :)) Very very interesting! :)
ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 20:52:01 IST 2015,@nr1woman oh that's sad :(
ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 20:37:12 IST 2015,Let's make plans then cancel them. #INFJ #introvert #planners http://t.co/FERmFVobXx
ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 20:34:26 IST 2015,@nr1woman I will too! Thank you! :)
ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 20:33:49 IST 2015,"@nr1woman I will search for her at the bookstore soon. Her stories are very interesting. I can imagine my tears, stories like this touch me"
ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 20:32:14 IST 2015,@nr1woman and even by your own family. I hurts me everyday. Thank you again for sharing the book! :)
ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 20:31:04 IST 2015,"@nr1woman I will read this soon, with guaranteed tears! I can't imagine being frustrated everyday. The feeling of betrayal by your own body."
ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 20:23:08 IST 2015,@nr1woman not yet! Who's the author?
ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 20:13:03 IST 2015,"Grandma has alzheimer's. Sometimes she gets really angry & worried that her kids haven't eaten yet. She'll curse at my aunt, her daughter. üòø"
ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 20:07:50 IST 2015,@_KingEdwards_ it's okay. Go back to work now :) haha
ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 20:06:01 IST 2015,@_KingEdwards_ sure! You can send me a DM if that's more convenient :) Good luck with work! Thanks! :)
ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 20:03:15 IST 2015,@_KingEdwards_ end what? Sorry overlapping conversations @.@
ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 20:01:54 IST 2015,"@_KingEdwards_ which one does this tweet pertain to? I'm sorry our ""spams"" are all mixed up :))"
ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 19:59:40 IST 2015,@Karol6ng totally agree! :)
ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 19:58:48 IST 2015,@_KingEdwards_ Oh my!! Dexter is my favorite show of all time (just ignore the last season) :) Good choice!! :)
ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 19:57:16 IST 2015,@_KingEdwards_ I certainly hope so! I don't want to be a corporate robot!! :))
ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 19:43:00 IST 2015,"@Karol6ng EXACTLY. I CARE SO MUCH. Yes I'll try not to hate myself, I just don't have anyone else to blame. Everyone seemed to have moved on"
ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 19:41:07 IST 2015,@_KingEdwards_ the blame is on Twitter! :) I always appreciate the interaction! :)
ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 19:40:16 IST 2015,@_KingEdwards_ By theater I don't mean I act (I'd be horrible & won't be able to deal with the attention). I just want watching performances
ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 19:38:45 IST 2015,"@_KingEdwards_ I want to enrich my intuition. Idk. In arts I'm really into photography, film, painting, theater, some writing. :)"
ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 19:37:12 IST 2015,@_KingEdwards_ really into psychology for some reason. I found my tv show choices revolving around psychology (eg Criminal Minds). Perhaps
ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 19:34:53 IST 2015,"@_KingEdwards_ me too! Ultimately I just want a comfortable, quiet life with my future family! :)"
ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 19:31:42 IST 2015,"@Karol6ng sometimes I hate myself for not ""getting over it"" even after years. I value loyalty so much betrayal seems to hurt the most."
ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 19:24:05 IST 2015,"I can always forgive, but sometimes I just can't forget. #INFJ"

ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 19:08:31 IST 2015,I like you a lot but too shy to start a conversation. Please know I think of you when I stare at my feet.  #introvert http://t.co/MdK06BVs4L
ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 19:07:06 IST 2015,@Hopevplatitudes I can imagine myself awkwardly trying to show you my acting skills. What a funny session :)))
ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 19:06:06 IST 2015,@Hopevplatitudes that sounds cool!! I'd like to try that tho I'm not sure if I can in front of a therapist (if my understanding is right)
ConfessionsINFJ,Mon Mar 30 16:48:02 IST 2015,@Hopevplatitudes We always seem drawn to self-expression. What's a dramatherapist btw? :)
