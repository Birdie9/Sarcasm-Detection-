canaryfollower,Sun Feb 28 22:46:18 IST 2016,@s34ley  It was a great day -it seems a long time ago - -dont want replica next season in play-offs- We can stay up !
canaryfollower,Sun Feb 28 22:27:16 IST 2016,@anitajbyrne @BigGrantHolt Perish the thought Anita-but we kept him one season ! after relegation  lets not go there - still time to go !
canaryfollower,Sun Feb 28 22:17:40 IST 2016,"@Tants7 @TomChambers1 Mind you- I felt like ""spitting and throwing ""-sometimes after NCFC  results -but we are a good bunch -usually !!"
canaryfollower,Sun Feb 28 22:14:16 IST 2016,@TomChambers1 @Tants7  Fair enough -!
canaryfollower,Sun Feb 28 22:11:45 IST 2016,"@Tants7 Lets just say ""we "" want to stay up -by fair means or foul  ! Were their fans that bad ? Did not come across  on media !"
canaryfollower,Sun Feb 28 21:52:12 IST 2016,@anitajbyrne @BigGrantHolt Never fully appreciated -due to change in position - Will he stay ? if we go down -sorry stay up !

canaryfollower,Sun Feb 28 21:20:24 IST 2016,@Tants7 @Adeotbc @RobinNCST I think we did that in January -but whether too late --I understand frustration with strikers but our priority ?
canaryfollower,Sun Feb 28 21:10:28 IST 2016,@Adeotbc @Tants7 @RobinNCST Who knows ?
canaryfollower,Sun Feb 28 21:02:52 IST 2016,@Tants7 @RobinNCST Yes- he probably would but would we have been in that position without Jerome-I agree with your view - clinical finisher!
canaryfollower,Sun Feb 28 20:57:09 IST 2016,@Tants7 @RobinNCST We all were gutted yesterday -but ! still shout for them- How many games to go? I know ! not looking at Champ list yet !!
