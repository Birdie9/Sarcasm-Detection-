robert_the_bear,Mon Nov 16 01:32:05 IST 2015,@greateranglia and then another bus to ingatestone and a train from there on. Really helpful... #sarcastic
robert_the_bear,Mon Nov 16 01:30:02 IST 2015,@greateranglia : this is a complete lie. now at marks try waiting for the 19:53 - still not here and turns out its one bus to Chelmsford 1/2
robert_the_bear,Mon Nov 16 01:25:24 IST 2015,@greateranglia @joewilson116 at least you can pay full whack for rail replacement bus...
robert_the_bear,Mon Nov 16 01:08:35 IST 2015,@greateranglia what do you advise I do?
robert_the_bear,Mon Nov 16 00:57:27 IST 2015,@greateranglia but normal bikes are allowed on the trains. Madness.
robert_the_bear,Mon Nov 16 00:50:31 IST 2015,@greateranglia cheers. No chance of getting a bike on the bus is there?
robert_the_bear,Mon Nov 16 00:41:07 IST 2015,"@greateranglia do the buses stop at the stations in between (witham, kelv etc) or go straight to ingatestone?"
robert_the_bear,Mon Nov 16 00:39:59 IST 2015,"@greateranglia yes, trying to work out which station to go to for speed due to the rail replacement"
robert_the_bear,Mon Nov 16 00:34:41 IST 2015,"@greateranglia going to London from colch or marks TEY, does the train stop at every station or straight to ingatestone from both?"
