CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 20:50:29 IST 2015,"@MuddPhil @mics147 @ibsf @mkammah Still at work, off to the snooker club soon! #lineupsfor3hours"
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 20:49:00 IST 2015,@MuddPhil @mics147 @ibsf @mkammah The internet is definitely up for 25fps these days guys! I'm giving up on it.Shame it has to be like this!
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 20:45:17 IST 2015,@MuddPhil @mics147 @ibsf @mkammah #shite
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 20:44:54 IST 2015,@HML1001 Me neither. Think he's not ready yet.
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 20:37:27 IST 2015,"@MuddPhil @mics147 @ibsf @mkammah They must be messing about with it, framerate went again too."
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 20:24:34 IST 2015,"@MutekiDaitarn @mkammah No, this one: https://t.co/QsFDujoMB7"
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 20:14:35 IST 2015,"No action on the IBSF stream yet, but the frame rate looks better @mkammah , hope it holds up!"
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 20:08:15 IST 2015,@ProSnookerBlog Think that one is a foregone conclusion. It's quite a shock Ben making it this far!
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 19:59:30 IST 2015,"@CueActionBlog @ProSnookerBlog Semis are starting now, final tomorrow."
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 19:59:07 IST 2015,"@MuddPhil @mics147 Hope he turns out better than Einsle, who was never quite up to main tour level."
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 19:53:52 IST 2015,"@MuddPhil @mics147 Don't think he has enough to beat Xintong, but it would be great to see him on tour!"
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 19:50:25 IST 2015,@MuddPhil @mics147 Mics will be grumpy with me for that :)
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 19:48:35 IST 2015,"@MuddPhil @mics147 No, just was keen for Casey to win :) I know him from when I lived in Ireland."
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 19:46:15 IST 2015,Wonder if @KleckersLukas will manage to take it to the final!
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 19:45:53 IST 2015,"@mics147 @MuddPhil Don't bother, it's shite! #shite The low frame-rate gives me a headache."
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 19:26:40 IST 2015,@SnookerHQ Really thought he had it there :(
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 19:24:44 IST 2015,Bugger :(
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 18:56:42 IST 2015,"@mkammah The scoring is all right, but the stream, even now the camera's straight, has too low a frame rate to be watchable. Sorry."
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 17:54:47 IST 2015,Listen to the genius that is Stephen Fry! https://t.co/xe7Ql7aAjA
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 15:55:05 IST 2015,"@SnookerHQ Serious trouble now though, 4-0 behind and he's done f-a so far."
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 15:19:55 IST 2015,@SnookerHQ Actually played him in a handicap tourney when I lived in Cork. I beat him but to be fair I got 40 start. #hatehandicaps
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 15:16:38 IST 2015,"@SnookerHQ Surprised Greg doesn't play the PTC's actually, he could do with the experience. His results in Q School as well show he can play"
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 15:16:09 IST 2015,"@SnookerHQ Kleckers, but it seems Kleckers is getting the better of him."
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 15:15:53 IST 2015,@SnookerHQ Yeah he's gotten better results than expected the last couple of these big tourneys I think. I'd actually made it 50-50 against
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 15:00:43 IST 2015,@patyamatty11 It looks like the wind is extruding it!
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 14:51:57 IST 2015,@SnookerHQ Go on Greg! #cork #gowanboy
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 14:49:58 IST 2015,@patyamatty11 But they're gorgeous and environment-friendly :)
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 14:37:05 IST 2015,@patyamatty11 I can dream can't I? No money for a Tesla anytime soon!
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 14:20:30 IST 2015,@patyamatty11 Nope
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 13:24:38 IST 2015,@patyamatty11 They're pretty nice but I prefer a Tesla :) #stickingtoascalemodelfornow

CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 11:49:05 IST 2015,@windowsserver Windows is like any Microsoft product: a shit way to lose money! #sucks
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 00:23:18 IST 2015,@mkammah @alan_mcmanus If there's no suitable venue in Egypt then don't hold it in Egypt. Ludicrous decision anyway.
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 00:22:38 IST 2015,@mkammah @alan_mcmanus Sorry to butt in but I've talked to several players and those aircons do f-all. Conditions disgraceful
CueTracker_Ron,Fri Nov 20 00:21:21 IST 2015,@mics147 Not very difficult looking at the amount of players from several countries
CueTracker_Ron,Thu Nov 19 23:02:35 IST 2015,"@SteveSnooker @fraserp147 Fair enough. Inconsistency in application easily fixed by using ball polishers, quite common in pool halls."
CueTracker_Ron,Thu Nov 19 22:48:59 IST 2015,@fraserp147 @SteveSnooker Agreed. What's your view Steve?
CueTracker_Ron,Thu Nov 19 21:38:00 IST 2015,@McChazzz How do you calculate these? Amount won divided by editions played? If so I get different numbers: https://t.co/bYzy48N85c
CueTracker_Ron,Thu Nov 19 21:19:10 IST 2015,"RT @fouldsy147: @alan_mcmanus completely agree, I mean we would never see a future Football World Cup played in sweltering conditions wouldâ€¦"
CueTracker_Ron,Thu Nov 19 21:12:53 IST 2015,"@alan_mcmanus Corruption has destroyed the IBSF, they no longer care about the game or its players."
CueTracker_Ron,Thu Nov 19 20:54:15 IST 2015,"@chrisgaynor2 I'll DM it, long story :)"
CueTracker_Ron,Thu Nov 19 20:51:13 IST 2015,"@chrisgaynor2 Do a good bit of research on it, it's a discussion which has been going on for nearly a year now and there's loads of views:)"
CueTracker_Ron,Thu Nov 19 20:48:30 IST 2015,"@chrisgaynor2 They don't use any right now, but most of the clubs on this planet use this: https://t.co/ZtlDjjDZaq"
CueTracker_Ron,Thu Nov 19 20:40:23 IST 2015,@michaelwhite147 @markwil147 @fraserp147 No it can't because they'll have machines to apply it so you get an even coat.
CueTracker_Ron,Thu Nov 19 20:18:15 IST 2015,"@MaximumSnooker ITV4 would be great, but whoever gets it, it's essential they keep @Eurosport coverage."
CueTracker_Ron,Thu Nov 19 20:08:35 IST 2015,"@davidroe147 @mics147 @patyamatty11 @snookerbacker Yeah true, they don't have place in the building to get 20 tables in..."

CueTracker_Ron,Thu Nov 19 19:49:54 IST 2015,@michaelwhite147 @markwil147 @fraserp147 Different could be better once you're used to it though?
CueTracker_Ron,Thu Nov 19 19:42:23 IST 2015,Ok so the IBSF has managed to put the camera straight. If only it was more than 3 frames/ second it'd be watchable:) https://t.co/rBXnvzpO7A
