sethpoho,Sat Feb 27 02:36:09 IST 2016,"It's a shame we don't have great video of Andy Bathgate in his prime 1954-1964. By his 30's he was beat up, lower scoring totals."
sethpoho,Sat Feb 27 02:33:42 IST 2016,"Andy's brother Frank Bathgate played only one more NHL game than Don Cherry. Playing 2 games for the @NYRangers in '52-53, Andy's rookie yr."
sethpoho,Sat Feb 27 02:31:56 IST 2016,"Bathgate's prime was way before the media age, but he compares to Tanguay, Sittler, Goulet, H. Sedin and Denis Savard, pretty good scorers.."
