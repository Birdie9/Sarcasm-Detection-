Jimbo_G_81,Wed Feb 24 03:24:18 IST 2016,"Lads I'm off to bed, wake me if Evans is sacked or Cellino fucks off #lufc"
Jimbo_G_81,Wed Feb 24 03:13:19 IST 2016,@PhilHayYEP Phil if you catch Evans ask if Stokes is anywhere near being called up to the first team
Jimbo_G_81,Wed Feb 24 02:41:14 IST 2016,@PhilHayYEP sounds like Ants season/career is over #lufc
Jimbo_G_81,Wed Feb 24 01:05:58 IST 2016,@TV3SportIreland would Martin campaign for Brian Kerr to return to our underage set up? #AskMartin
Jimbo_G_81,Wed Feb 24 00:57:37 IST 2016,"@Ruby_N11 sorry, it didn't follow on the previous tweet. We have our answer on the Caryole messages. Looks like it was true"
Jimbo_G_81,Wed Feb 24 00:24:16 IST 2016,@Ruby_N11 and I think we have our answer pal
Jimbo_G_81,Tue Feb 23 21:11:10 IST 2016,@TV3Ireland are we persuing English born players like Patrick Bamford & Dan Crowley to replace our retirees after #euro16 ? #AskMartin

Jimbo_G_81,Sun Feb 21 15:08:13 IST 2016,"@Ruby_N11 no, I'd rather wait until Cellino is gone. Any replacement will be another underwhelming yes man doing Cellinos bidding #lufc"
Jimbo_G_81,Sun Feb 21 14:29:25 IST 2016,"@ephemeraljoy 2 dream scenarios-1.A rich local owner 2. Bring back Grayson However, I get the feeling Cellino will stick around to spite us"
Jimbo_G_81,Sun Feb 21 14:19:12 IST 2016,@jwh1982 @barryomahony4 @mattkeeny I could live with that!
Jimbo_G_81,Sun Feb 21 14:09:10 IST 2016,@jwh1982 @barryomahony4 @mattkeeny I'd have Grayson back before Mac
Jimbo_G_81,Sun Feb 21 13:53:48 IST 2016,"RT @barryomahony4: #lufc fans, are you happy with Steve Evans as Head Coach? (RT when voted to get as many people as possible to vote)."
Jimbo_G_81,Sun Feb 21 01:42:50 IST 2016,Huge pressure on Cellino the last few weeks. I smell a managerial sacking coming over the hill to take the spotlight off himself #lufc
Jimbo_G_81,Sun Feb 21 00:28:51 IST 2016,@LPP2014 let's just keep chipping away at Cellino and the rest will fall into place
Jimbo_G_81,Sat Feb 20 23:52:57 IST 2016,@jenbarlufc two traits that have abandoned us since Cellino arrived
Jimbo_G_81,Sat Feb 20 23:39:03 IST 2016,"@jenbarlufc true,he's useless but no self respecting manager will take a job under Cellino,he'll just be replaced with same calibre manager"
Jimbo_G_81,Sat Feb 20 23:32:42 IST 2016,"@tomdaniels401 @APOPEY oh no, don't you remember?? There was the ''Byram money AND MORE''"
Jimbo_G_81,Sat Feb 20 23:19:16 IST 2016,@PhilHayYEP I'd also put Evans in the category of 'not good enough'
Jimbo_G_81,Sat Feb 20 22:04:59 IST 2016,I think I'm pretty much at the end of my patience with Steve Evans #lufc

Jimbo_G_81,Tue Feb 16 05:06:33 IST 2016,@NorthernMisery I can confirm he did.
Jimbo_G_81,Tue Feb 16 05:04:25 IST 2016,@jenbarlufc scandalous! Cost me a bleedin' fortune rebooking flights. This man must surely be near the end of his reign
Jimbo_G_81,Tue Feb 16 04:16:21 IST 2016,@PhilHayYEP cheers Phil
Jimbo_G_81,Tue Feb 16 04:14:21 IST 2016,@PhilHayYEP was MC at the game tonight to witness the goings on?
Jimbo_G_81,Fri Feb 12 01:25:57 IST 2016,@Ruby_N11 we'll know soon enough if/when his loan is 'terminated'

Jimbo_G_81,Fri Feb 12 00:22:24 IST 2016,@PhilHayYEP do you think he's taking heed of the message or do you think he'll struggle on just to spite us?

Jimbo_G_81,Sun Jan 31 22:59:31 IST 2016,My prediction Man City away round five #lufc
Jimbo_G_81,Sun Jan 31 17:18:59 IST 2016,@WALMOT3 I honestly don't think Lafferty will add goals to our team
Jimbo_G_81,Fri Jan 29 22:26:57 IST 2016,@NorthernMisery I concur
Jimbo_G_81,Fri Jan 29 22:19:38 IST 2016,@NorthernMisery do you think it could be Cellino selling up or Evans getting the old  heeve-ho at the end of the season and not giving him ¬£
Jimbo_G_81,Fri Jan 29 22:02:39 IST 2016,"@NorthernMisery as I said earlier, these miserly bids being rejected will lead to a 'we tried to bring players in' excuse on Monday #lufc"
Jimbo_G_81,Fri Jan 29 16:14:12 IST 2016,"@WACCOE a bid that low is designed for no more incomings & a shrug of the shoulders when the window closes saying ''ah well, we tried''"
Jimbo_G_81,Thu Jan 28 18:45:54 IST 2016,@PhilHayYEP this smells of either Cellino selling up or replacing Evans in the summer and giving no funds this window
