gamecockrev,Tue Feb 23 19:17:57 IST 2016,"@aamandalynn oh yeah, rub it in! Haha"
gamecockrev,Mon Feb 22 09:10:10 IST 2016,"If you would ask Jesus sincerely to give you the life you've been desiring, trusting that He will, He will. Come to Him!"
gamecockrev,Mon Feb 22 07:57:34 IST 2016,Saw #RisenMovie tonight. I give it üëç. Was moved to tears a couple of times reminded of the joy Jesus brings.
gamecockrev,Mon Feb 22 07:49:09 IST 2016,@KevinCabe sitting down to watch now!
gamecockrev,Mon Feb 22 04:13:10 IST 2016,"@drantbradley I not worried about being ""gotten"" by a Lutheran."
gamecockrev,Mon Feb 22 04:08:16 IST 2016,"@drantbradley pretty funny. I'm not going to stand in front of a Lutheran judge one day, thank goodness!"
gamecockrev,Mon Feb 22 03:57:04 IST 2016,"@drantbradley I would love to sit down over coffee one day. We live on Long Island now, that is, if you can do so with a Gamecock! Lol"
gamecockrev,Mon Feb 22 03:53:51 IST 2016,"@drantbradley I went to @sebts. We trust Bible. We learned it was interpreted by human agents, but in teams, to at least seek authority"
gamecockrev,Mon Feb 22 03:50:28 IST 2016,"@drantbradley agree, that's why we go to the authors intent the best we can. We interpret his intent in context with whole of scripture"
gamecockrev,Mon Feb 22 03:48:54 IST 2016,"@drantbradley the meaning & the practice of it in scripture seem pretty clear, don't they?"
gamecockrev,Mon Feb 22 03:46:21 IST 2016,"@drantbradley I believe it's possible to seek to remove them. For instance, I try when I correspond with you to remove my Clemson bias. Lol"
gamecockrev,Mon Feb 22 03:41:36 IST 2016,"@drantbradley trust those who stick as close to the original languages, no bias"
gamecockrev,Mon Feb 22 03:34:52 IST 2016,@drantbradley we know their original intent because we can trust the interpreters. How does Falwell define all evangelicals?
gamecockrev,Mon Feb 22 03:28:35 IST 2016,"@drantbradley I would say let's let the author of the bible tell us what's important-people, and trump clearly does not like people haha"
gamecockrev,Mon Feb 22 03:24:54 IST 2016,"@drantbradley how does Jerry Falwell, Jr define evangelical?"
gamecockrev,Mon Feb 22 03:24:19 IST 2016,@drantbradley biblical values are different than biblical issues.
gamecockrev,Mon Feb 22 03:18:26 IST 2016,@drantbradley just saying. Supporting candidates that are the exact opposite of biblical values has to at least make one think.
gamecockrev,Mon Feb 22 03:12:29 IST 2016,@drantbradley at least based on what we can see & hear that is.
gamecockrev,Mon Feb 22 03:11:42 IST 2016,"@drantbradley it scares me to see how so many ""Christians"" are supporting him. He may be the most anti-Christ-like candidate running."
gamecockrev,Mon Feb 22 03:03:08 IST 2016,@drantbradley he doesn't come close to representing me. I'll just stick with follower of Jesus.
gamecockrev,Mon Feb 22 03:00:01 IST 2016,"@drantbradley what is your definition of evangelical? I consider myself one, but I'd never vote Trump."
gamecockrev,Sun Feb 21 22:57:03 IST 2016,The good news about Jesus transcends culture & it is powerful enough to give life to any person!
gamecockrev,Sun Feb 21 08:20:37 IST 2016,"RT @JayHardwick: Seeing an African-American Sen, Indian-American Gov, & Caucasian Rep. on stage w/ a Cuban-American Pres. Candidate is powe‚Ä¶"
gamecockrev,Sun Feb 21 07:52:15 IST 2016,"Trump says he's going to build the biggest military in the world. He better, if he wins we'll be at war with everyone."
gamecockrev,Sun Feb 21 07:44:37 IST 2016,My heart breaks for the nation I live in tonight. We truly have no hope but Jesus.
gamecockrev,Sat Feb 20 19:40:10 IST 2016,Looking forward to sharing about how Jesus healed an official‚Äôs son as told in John 4 tonight! You can & should come to Jesus‚Ä¶He is good!
gamecockrev,Sat Feb 20 09:41:30 IST 2016,The more I study the gospels (Eye-witness reports on Jesus‚Äô life) I get excited about what I learn about Jesus. You would be too!
gamecockrev,Sat Feb 20 08:24:58 IST 2016,"Praying for my friends in SC for tomorrow. I'm glad I don't have to vote yet, not sure who I can trust amongst those who can win."

gamecockrev,Sat Feb 20 04:04:36 IST 2016,Selfie with good friends! https://t.co/EnE2M1kd37
gamecockrev,Sat Feb 20 01:13:34 IST 2016,"@dcaraviello it seems like college guys would enjoy going somewhere like that, especially if they're only practicing 2 hours for 3 days."
gamecockrev,Sat Feb 20 00:45:21 IST 2016,"@dcaraviello then why wouldn't every college coach in America schedule their opening week in Hawaii, and use it in recruiting?"
gamecockrev,Sat Feb 20 00:16:02 IST 2016,"@dcaraviello athlete's time aside, is this not an impermissible benefit for these players? What's to stop teams from practicing in Hawaii?"
gamecockrev,Fri Feb 19 08:42:37 IST 2016,"I love it when God gives me the chance to talk to someone about following Jesus! And oh, you get new, true friends in it as well."
gamecockrev,Thu Feb 18 18:49:04 IST 2016,I have not watched #ESPN in probably a month or so. What has happened to me?
gamecockrev,Thu Feb 18 00:33:57 IST 2016,@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS he skirted around the question yesterday about his hypocrisy.
gamecockrev,Wed Feb 17 06:40:04 IST 2016,Please pray for me. I'm speaking at Stony Brook University tonight around 9:30!
gamecockrev,Tue Feb 16 19:10:49 IST 2016,The evangelical culture has been told that unless you're radically serving Jesus you aren't truly serving Him. It's the new fundamentalism.
gamecockrev,Tue Feb 16 03:40:34 IST 2016,The word mundane sounds so mundane.
gamecockrev,Tue Feb 16 03:23:53 IST 2016,LIVE on #Periscope https://t.co/FTecjRW0a0
gamecockrev,Mon Feb 15 21:08:30 IST 2016,I'm looking for a missions team to come up & help us over Easter weekend. Any takers?
gamecockrev,Mon Feb 15 18:03:48 IST 2016,@GeoKearns it IS cold up here. Supposed to warm up a bit.
gamecockrev,Mon Feb 15 04:31:08 IST 2016,Perfect weather for grilling a Valentines steak! https://t.co/aJ6bZznJvt
gamecockrev,Mon Feb 15 03:40:49 IST 2016,"SC, you gotta end Trump's run to the presidency. Please show everybody you're smarter than NH!"
gamecockrev,Sat Feb 13 22:40:35 IST 2016,@dcaraviello must've thought his team wasn't fired up.
gamecockrev,Sat Feb 13 21:47:48 IST 2016,@dcaraviello but somehow he figured out where Kentucky was?!
gamecockrev,Sat Feb 13 21:46:06 IST 2016,@Rev_Pope I fall asleep in those at about a 65% rate! Best $12.50 I've ever spent on a nap!
gamecockrev,Sat Feb 13 20:05:53 IST 2016,It‚Äôs going to be a bit chilly this afternoon when our church meets. Looking forward to hanging out on the inside! https://t.co/PkabBtPbQ7
gamecockrev,Fri Feb 12 20:01:33 IST 2016,@MrCFB @GregSankey why doesn't every college football coach schedule a practice trip to Hawaii? What a great recruiting pitch!
