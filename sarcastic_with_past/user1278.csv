interela1000,Sun Dec 13 21:13:43 IST 2015,@interela1000 so being #sarcastic through text will only lead yourself into unnecessary troubles.
interela1000,Sun Dec 13 21:12:53 IST 2015,@interela1000 but sarcasm is about the tone of a person voice and behaviour. That doesn't translate well into text.
interela1000,Sun Dec 13 21:12:32 IST 2015,"@interela1000 it was all about survival and defending yourself, so everything (even a joke) became a threat to me."
interela1000,Sun Dec 13 21:12:07 IST 2015,"@interela1000 I admit, I have a hard time understanding sarcasm, because I've been bullied for so long that I can't tell the difference."
interela1000,Sun Dec 13 21:11:32 IST 2015,I honestly don't like people who thinks you're stupid because you don't understand sarcasm in text form.
interela1000,Sun Dec 13 18:21:26 IST 2015,Jag gillade ett videoklipp på @YouTube från @screenrant https://t.co/F7wVo35kGC 10 Movie Mistakes That Slipped Through Editing
interela1000,Sun Dec 13 17:28:19 IST 2015,"Now the animation is done!

I'm happy that it came out the way I imagine it~

interela1000,Sat Dec 12 22:28:54 IST 2015,@The_Extrange @MistahOso @colepram just to avoid unnecessary fights and conflicts.
interela1000,Sat Dec 12 22:28:43 IST 2015,@The_Extrange @MistahOso @colepram I kinda experienced that. But I suggest you ask me before flagging my tweets.
interela1000,Sat Dec 12 22:26:44 IST 2015,"@MistahOso @The_Extrange @colepram so you went after what everyone else said, but didn't even consider to ask me personally? Wtf..."
interela1000,Sat Dec 12 21:49:20 IST 2015,Finally got to the Cathedral! #thebindingofisaac #wiiu https://t.co/GRLuMSk3zh
interela1000,Sat Dec 12 21:37:36 IST 2015,@MistahOso @The_Extrange @colepram what do you even mean?
interela1000,Sat Dec 12 20:48:33 IST 2015,"@interela1000 I even made an artwork of that many months ago, that #GamerGate doesn't support doxing https://t.co/UqDWmP7AZg"
interela1000,Sat Dec 12 20:47:54 IST 2015,@The_Extrange I know how that feels like. Happened to me too.
interela1000,Sat Dec 12 20:46:46 IST 2015,@kikesburg @MistahOso @The_Extrange @colepram it's spelled both ways. Who cares.
interela1000,Sat Dec 12 20:46:28 IST 2015,"@interela1000 what I want to say was that I won't give you a pass because you support the same thing that I do, but also support doxxing"
interela1000,Sat Dec 12 20:45:46 IST 2015,@interela1000 that's not what I meant if you really believe that. I worded it badly and it was my own fault for the confusion at hand.
interela1000,Sat Dec 12 20:45:16 IST 2015,I want to apologise for the massive confusion. People seem to think I'm accusing #GamerGate of supporting doxxers.
interela1000,Sat Dec 12 20:44:14 IST 2015,"@The_Extrange @TrueManInGreen @colepram nah, not much :P I can if I want to :)"
interela1000,Sat Dec 12 20:43:40 IST 2015,"@MistahOso @The_Extrange @colepram please, ask me what I meant before jumping to conclusion that I'm a cussing GG for supporting doxxing"
interela1000,Sat Dec 12 20:42:55 IST 2015,"@The_Extrange @sneakyblackhat @colepram thanks, because people seem to assume I'm attacking #GamerGate for supporting doxing"
interela1000,Sat Dec 12 20:42:28 IST 2015,@TrueManInGreen @The_Extrange @colepram and I even made and artwork for that. https://t.co/Kf0SMgH5xk
interela1000,Sat Dec 12 20:40:28 IST 2015,"@colepram that's not what I said. I said EVEN IF you support GG like me, but approve of doxing, I won't treat you specially."
interela1000,Sat Dec 12 20:39:31 IST 2015,@The_Extrange @colepram it's cool. It happens. I just said that I don't treat you different even if you're interested the same group as me
interela1000,Sat Dec 12 20:38:31 IST 2015,"@sneakyblackhat @The_Extrange @colepram exactly, I said that I don't support doxxers even if they support the same group as me."
interela1000,Sat Dec 12 20:37:40 IST 2015,@The_Extrange @colepram how? I had 140 characters to explain what I meant.
interela1000,Sat Dec 12 20:37:03 IST 2015,"@The_Extrange @TrueManInGreen @colepram because I won't be okay with doxing, even if you support GamerGate like I do. That's why"
interela1000,Sat Dec 12 20:36:23 IST 2015,@The_Extrange @colepram how does it sound differently? Maybe you just read it wrong?
interela1000,Sat Dec 12 20:35:57 IST 2015,@The_Extrange @TrueManInGreen @colepram ---for supporting doxing just because you're in the same group as me.
interela1000,Sat Dec 12 20:35:41 IST 2015,@The_Extrange @TrueManInGreen @colepram I did NOT say that the doxing supporter was from GG. I said I won't let you pass---
interela1000,Sat Dec 12 20:34:29 IST 2015,@The_Extrange @colepram I didn't even word it that GG support doxing? Are you serious?
interela1000,Sat Dec 12 20:33:20 IST 2015,"@The_Extrange @colepram I said that if you support doxing, but you're also GamerGater like me, I won't treat you differently."
interela1000,Sat Dec 12 20:32:51 IST 2015,@The_Extrange @colepram I don't accuse the group I support? Why would I do that? I didn't mean GamerGate as a group.
interela1000,Sat Dec 12 20:32:17 IST 2015,"@The_Extrange @colepram that's not want in saying. I'm saying that even if you support the same group as me, I won't treat you differently"
