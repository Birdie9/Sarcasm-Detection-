zeezy90,Wed Jun 03 11:46:05 IST 2015,"@CarltonFC toughest opponent you played against, player wise?"
zeezy90,Wed Jun 03 11:39:19 IST 2015,"@CarltonFC @DochertySam Sam I've realised you ditched the extreme hair style of last year, have you since sat Menz down about his man bun?"
zeezy90,Wed Jun 03 11:38:02 IST 2015,"@CarltonFC @DochertySam Hi Sam, which youngster at the club will next  cement their spot in the 22? (Crippa excluded)"
zeezy90,Wed Jun 03 09:47:50 IST 2015,"@emtwenty @PrincessPark7 I don't know, I love Yaz but that's a sign of the lack of professionalism in our club. We know Gowers did the same."
zeezy90,Wed Jun 03 09:42:34 IST 2015,@emtwenty @PrincessPark7 haha nuh I saw that. I was confused as to the inconsequential call. Pretty poor by Yaz

zeezy90,Sun May 31 12:34:27 IST 2015,"BlaineTrain had a good day, nobody really had a poor day and the conditions didn't allow a good game. Whiley, Holman, Kreuzer could be ins"
zeezy90,Sun May 31 12:33:47 IST 2015,"Kreuzer got through the game well, had some good moments. Holman and Clem spent the day jumper punching anyone in arm's length."
zeezy90,Sun May 31 12:28:30 IST 2015,"@emtwenty @C_Filippo23 Had a chat with Gaz, quote: ""Cristian who?"""

zeezy90,Sun May 31 10:38:51 IST 2015,"Not much to report, not the worst match but wet and just a slog #proudlynorth Kreuze doing well"

zeezy90,Sat May 30 12:00:11 IST 2015,@pickle2401 when do we play?
zeezy90,Sat May 30 11:48:12 IST 2015,@emtwenty We draft him and try to make him a mobile winger lol
zeezy90,Sat May 30 11:09:36 IST 2015,@Mezzoculo Walsh maybe but not sure we'd play too many youngsters in the one side. Gowers has a bit of work to do still.
zeezy90,Sat May 30 11:01:20 IST 2015,"@LinnyHaze ahh yes, 140 characters but there's also Jaksch and Fields"
zeezy90,Sat May 30 11:00:33 IST 2015,Reckon if there's an easier-ish game (i know) that we might even see the VOKHO RAINBOW!

zeezy90,Sat May 30 07:23:52 IST 2015,@aamer_rahman people call him attention seeking for calling out fans that make derogatory comments to him
zeezy90,Sat May 30 07:23:00 IST 2015,@aamer_rahman been about 3weeks of him being relentlessly booed. White privelige media gone nuts that he did a war dance in Indigenous rnd
