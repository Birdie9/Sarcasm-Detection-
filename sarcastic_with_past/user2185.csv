Pseudony_Ms,Sat Feb 27 05:56:07 IST 2016,@voluptuouspanic I somehow doubt this guy's claim to being a feminist previously.

Pseudony_Ms,Sat Feb 27 05:16:15 IST 2016,"@sarahjbarnett I don't really think there was much of one, other than to vaguely connect a bunch of set pieces."
Pseudony_Ms,Sat Feb 27 04:00:15 IST 2016,@lmfbs @bluetopnz That the kind of life we're forced to measure ourselves against as 'success' isn't what we want?

Pseudony_Ms,Sat Feb 27 02:52:13 IST 2016,"@bluetopnz Even if you don't want them, they ARE what society judges success in life & as an adult by, and it's near impossible not to feel."
Pseudony_Ms,Sat Feb 27 02:51:16 IST 2016,@bluetopnz ... the value society outs on those things means it's very difficult not to still judge ourselves based on that measure.
Pseudony_Ms,Sat Feb 27 02:50:26 IST 2016,"@bluetopnz But I remind myself I don't want the normal life, I don't want the 8-5 job, house in the burbs, kids, etc, etc. But of course ..."

Pseudony_Ms,Fri Feb 26 10:01:56 IST 2016,"@LI_politico At the moment we have only one side doing this, and not very well at that. And the other isn't constrained by such."
Pseudony_Ms,Fri Feb 26 10:00:54 IST 2016,"@LI_politico Yeah, that's what I want. I want an opposition that THINKS, is CRITICAL, and argues from evidence. Our society needs this."
Pseudony_Ms,Fri Feb 26 09:58:19 IST 2016,@StuFlemingNZ @LI_politico *nods* and I try very hard not to conflate repulsiveness of morals with a lack of intelligence.
Pseudony_Ms,Fri Feb 26 09:57:25 IST 2016,@bluetopnz @LI_politico Uni libertarians today are the Uni anarchists of the 80s.

Pseudony_Ms,Fri Feb 26 09:50:24 IST 2016,"@StuFlemingNZ @LI_politico No, I'd credit them with intelligence too, for all that I find their conclusions & political behaviour repulsive."
Pseudony_Ms,Fri Feb 26 09:49:15 IST 2016,"@LI_politico As @bluetopnz indicated, where ideology is all, reality and the nature of it, are not investigated. Or even desired to be."
