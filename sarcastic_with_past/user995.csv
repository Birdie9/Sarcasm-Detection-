jenren5977,Sat Jan 16 01:56:44 IST 2016,I tweeted a #sarcastic joke about burning my ex-hubby's house down.  Someone sent me a help hotline-He doesn't even have a house-I got it.üòÇ

jenren5977,Fri Jan 15 13:28:11 IST 2016,@Eddieonfox We do the refillable popcorn sometimes but it never fails- one kid will eat so much butter-he pukes or moans the whole movie.

jenren5977,Fri Jan 15 03:48:04 IST 2016,It feels like Spring in #Nashville right now. I ‚ù§Ô∏è this place-might move myself & my kids here.  Bonus:  They have a #KYWildcat community.

jenren5977,Wed Jan 13 13:34:56 IST 2016,@uhbroncofan Your NBA pick'em is so fine. FYI:Cousins & Wall both played @KY 2009/2010(calipari's-1st year)SEC champs-both 1st round draft.
jenren5977,Wed Jan 13 13:16:34 IST 2016,@benmaller @Eddieonfox @DannyGradio @uhbroncofan wow-Real talk is real mean as shit and that's a real lie that Eddie has no friends.

jenren5977,Mon Jan 11 00:41:00 IST 2016,I think we agree this is a frigid football game-Watch the players exhale-it's like smoke from one of those party fog machines. #SEAvsMIN üèâ

jenren5977,Sun Jan 10 10:17:48 IST 2016,@BlindScottBos @PatsFan1280 Amateurs? Is that what they call the NBA draft now? Cause It's hard to tell if it's a draft or #KY reunion. #BBN
jenren5977,Sun Jan 10 10:11:39 IST 2016,@BlindScottBos @PatsFan1280 okay punk- last yr.- perfect regular season 38-0 and even our third platoon was drafted to the NBA-the usual.üòä
