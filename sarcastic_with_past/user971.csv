Robostocks123,Mon Jan 18 01:50:33 IST 2016,"Iran was producing 1.1m barrels/day last month and they will this month.  Who end customer is, who cares.  It's NOT incremental supply"
Robostocks123,Mon Jan 18 01:47:16 IST 2016,@EMostaque @BarbarianCap  how is Iranian oil incremental?.  It was going somewhere and now finding new place.  They weren't drinking it
Robostocks123,Sat Jan 16 23:38:38 IST 2016,Let's pretend China data over weekend is mediocre. Why is every data point treated as incremental.
Robostocks123,Sat Jan 16 21:07:27 IST 2016,@JohnKerry @BarackObama you allow oil exports at lows in oil and let Iran breathe $100b of cash inflows as they are imploding #timelystuff
Robostocks123,Sat Jan 16 03:52:27 IST 2016,@marcuslemonis Worked on Wall Street 20+ years & know co modeling as well as anyone. Your ability to break down biz to essence is amazing.
Robostocks123,Sat Jan 16 03:48:12 IST 2016,@marcuslemonis btw your friend who works or helps out owners at Momma Gyro on Lex says hello!
Robostocks123,Sat Jan 16 03:47:19 IST 2016,@marcuslemonis terrific.  That was one company you really seemed to re-tool their products and margins well.  NYC landlords greedy as hell
Robostocks123,Sat Jan 16 03:39:27 IST 2016,@marcuslemonis say it isn't so.  COURAGE B turnaround is over?! I see everything must go signs on NYC store.  Ain't easy even when smart
Robostocks123,Sat Jan 16 03:08:10 IST 2016,RT @ScottMinerd: At least three down months in LEIs have preceded every US recession. We havenâ€™t had one yet. https://t.co/URUS7nd9Bx
Robostocks123,Sat Jan 16 03:01:40 IST 2016,@sharkbiotech TRIN hit 5 today.
Robostocks123,Sat Jan 16 03:01:18 IST 2016,@htsfhickey your paper portfolio always makes.  It's so darn consistent I am starting to wonder
Robostocks123,Sat Jan 16 02:54:39 IST 2016,Ran NYC marathon first time ever in 2015.  Feels like I have run another 2-3 in 2016
Robostocks123,Sat Jan 16 02:36:59 IST 2016,RT @WhiteCoatMafia: There comes a point when you realize that about 80% of everything you see and hear is bullshit.
Robostocks123,Sat Jan 16 02:36:12 IST 2016,Bizarre $fcx up 3.6% at the close.  Guess no one owns it anymore.
Robostocks123,Sat Jan 16 00:13:47 IST 2016,Mutual fund great job. Get killed.  Blame markets/outflows. Just kinda closet index.  Yes don't make huge bucks but kinda a fraud.  Takers?
Robostocks123,Fri Jan 15 23:40:37 IST 2016,@vexmark and prior they made that oil and drank it?  It's not exactly incremental but whatever #dumbwins
Robostocks123,Fri Jan 15 23:38:29 IST 2016,RT @techwhitepapers: the day we wake up and Iran is allowed to market oil .. will be the same as any other day.
Robostocks123,Fri Jan 15 21:06:26 IST 2016,Thanks to @vegastrader pointing out TRIN hit 5 today.  That's as extreme as will see
Robostocks123,Fri Jan 15 19:42:40 IST 2016,Reads like fraud.  Always heard trial design made no sense.  Wish I listened to that chatter  https://t.co/eyvmWtU7rn
Robostocks123,Fri Jan 15 19:13:16 IST 2016,"@TheEuchre Reminds of 2008 oil at $120 when were swimming in it and ""investors"" kept piling in causing further upside."
Robostocks123,Fri Jan 15 18:02:54 IST 2016,"@LongShortTrader @TheEuchre Iran is totally new news, completely unexpected and incremental to problem of supply #dumb"
Robostocks123,Fri Jan 15 18:02:13 IST 2016,RT @LongShortTrader: PEOPLE drive markets up and down. https://t.co/QcHkLHmSoy
Robostocks123,Fri Jan 15 17:58:22 IST 2016,Everyone can't say oil needs to go to $20 and be right can they?  Consensus rarely works. 2% o-supply means $100 to $20?  2 under mean 100?
Robostocks123,Fri Jan 15 17:54:18 IST 2016,@zerohedge the positive is my copper necklace is now cheaper!!
Robostocks123,Fri Jan 15 17:53:21 IST 2016,@zerohedge I think you beat your respective partner in evenings lol.  You always only point out negatives
Robostocks123,Fri Jan 15 07:44:06 IST 2016,Almost ready to turn off repub debate.  Maria and what's his name are total tools in their ?s (reading from notes) and nonsense answers
Robostocks123,Fri Jan 15 07:00:44 IST 2016,Am I the only one who finds the government settlements like $gs for $5b for mortgages disgusting?  That money goes into govt coffer toilet
Robostocks123,Fri Jan 15 06:34:08 IST 2016,The market summed up in a great cartoon https://t.co/h3UPkVmaR7
Robostocks123,Fri Jan 15 04:18:29 IST 2016,@brianfires from conf call they have a lot of potential funding sources like China deal they did and JVs for liquidity.  Have WF report?
Robostocks123,Fri Jan 15 04:12:40 IST 2016,@brianfires do you have their report handy to DM me?
Robostocks123,Fri Jan 15 03:13:27 IST 2016,RT @inner_scorecard: @Robostocks123 Looks like this is why it's so hard to blend value and momentum in practice.
Robostocks123,Fri Jan 15 03:10:18 IST 2016,"@inner_scorecard well said!  Guess why the swings are this wild.  Sell low buy high for ""trend"" to continue."
Robostocks123,Fri Jan 15 03:08:19 IST 2016,Very hated rally.  Funny how seems everyone interested to buy a few % if can get there.  #counterintuitive
Robostocks123,Thu Jan 14 21:25:24 IST 2016,@Matlack_Ltd @DividendMaster why asking him.  Been dead wrong buried us all lol
Robostocks123,Thu Jan 14 18:44:02 IST 2016,$cemp really powerful presentation at JPM.  worth a listen
Robostocks123,Thu Jan 14 06:03:01 IST 2016,"Today, I hate everyone.  RT if agree, unless of course I win the powerball"
Robostocks123,Wed Jan 13 04:49:50 IST 2016,This is opposite of what I wrote about at $120 oil and agree with them. It's mostly financial monkeys trading https://t.co/LJWBQdLgOe
Robostocks123,Wed Jan 13 04:47:02 IST 2016,@Robostocks123 I tried oil long once last week and said no thanks.  Unfortunately rest of my stuff thinks it's OIL
Robostocks123,Wed Jan 13 04:45:17 IST 2016,"My $uso summary is days of inventory. we aren't swimming in it so when prod turns down harder, price will rip faster than anyone expects"
Robostocks123,Wed Jan 13 04:43:25 IST 2016,This is scary one that has started to turn down finally. Weekly oil production. Oil Px inflection anyone's guess https://t.co/qIxZMmwva4
Robostocks123,Wed Jan 13 04:40:49 IST 2016,This is days of inventory gasoline.  Very tame $uga.  Oil production chart next https://t.co/2XIJYbXsj2
Robostocks123,Wed Jan 13 04:37:55 IST 2016,$uso we have crept back to 30 days supply but that can be fixed in a month of draws.  Chart is ex SPR https://t.co/ySbHtmBB90
Robostocks123,Wed Jan 13 04:36:36 IST 2016,Reading EIA website to remind context oil problem.  4 charts.  This one shows days of gas inventory same since 1982 https://t.co/kPliAoipXF
Robostocks123,Wed Jan 13 03:57:20 IST 2016,@rajramaswamy old system worked.  Now I pay $50k a year for other people's insurance and my own plan couldn't keep. #obamalied
Robostocks123,Wed Jan 13 03:42:39 IST 2016,Did your accountant tell you how much you paid for obamacare this year for others to get insurance?
Robostocks123,Wed Jan 13 03:25:28 IST 2016,@MintzmyerInvest makes sense.  Charterers know silly to pay $80k for 1-3 years when it's volatile.  $50-60k is max imho for 2-3 yrs
Robostocks123,Wed Jan 13 03:09:48 IST 2016,@MintzmyerInvest lol.  Will give you credit if they work as you have stuck neck out a few times in them and not running from the call
Robostocks123,Wed Jan 13 02:28:27 IST 2016,@Vconomics @jennablan @GainsPainsCapit they only use strong dollar for oil down when have nothing else to say
Robostocks123,Wed Jan 13 01:59:02 IST 2016,"@MintzmyerInvest $nm charter ins going to kill them.  $nmm might survive it, might. You think $nna and $nap insulated from parent I assume"
