YNB,Sun Feb 28 01:04:41 IST 2016,@ee_neh thanks
YNB,Sun Feb 28 01:00:19 IST 2016,@dougmatlock Same.
YNB,Sun Feb 28 00:59:51 IST 2016,And if you find yourself creating new twitter pages to continue to harass folks who have already blocked you. You may need a new hobby.
YNB,Sun Feb 28 00:58:06 IST 2016,"If that's something you do often, you may want to ask yourself why & what purpose it's serving. I promise there's a better use of your time."
YNB,Sun Feb 28 00:55:17 IST 2016,I have never popped up in the feed of someone I don't know & am not following to deposit negativity. I will never understand the inclination
YNB,Sun Feb 28 00:53:33 IST 2016,@Gomes96 Please read my feed & realize my purpose in starting this conversation. It has been clearly stated. I'm trying to sway no one.
YNB,Sun Feb 28 00:18:57 IST 2016,"Talking of how awesome you are & how well you're doing in the polls doesn't lay out your plan. What are you going to do, man?! #CmonSon! ðŸ˜’"
YNB,Sun Feb 28 00:17:01 IST 2016,"When candidates prefer to play the dozens instead of sharing what they're actually going to do for our country, it's a sad, sad day."
YNB,Sun Feb 28 00:15:07 IST 2016,"#AboutYesterday My beautiful friend, @BevySmith and I after #Bevelations, her @SiriusXM radioâ€¦ https://t.co/RDdj8oaSEI"
YNB,Sat Feb 27 23:17:59 IST 2016,@batmankm @AMCTalkingDead So. Very. AWESOME!
YNB,Sat Feb 27 23:17:27 IST 2016,"@hairandmemes We just do it respectfully. Which I prefer on my page. Anyway, thanks for your perspective. You take care."
YNB,Sat Feb 27 23:15:34 IST 2016,@hairandmemes You may have missed it. I don't block due to differing opinions. I have great convos with folks I don't agree w/ all the time.
YNB,Sat Feb 27 23:05:03 IST 2016,@jmorgue There's no higher compliment than that. Thank you! #ButTeachers
YNB,Sat Feb 27 23:04:22 IST 2016,"@hairandmemes Or the Mary Poppins version, if you prefer: ""A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down."" Be nice or leave is my motto."
YNB,Sat Feb 27 23:03:31 IST 2016,"@hairandmemes Even the Bible says that you can be wise, talented etc...but if you do it without love it will not resonate."
YNB,Sat Feb 27 23:00:24 IST 2016,@cherylhe For sure!
YNB,Sat Feb 27 22:59:35 IST 2016,"@hairandmemes Oh well. That's what happens, I guess. I don't interact with those who are unkind. Nor do I have to. That's my right too."
YNB,Sat Feb 27 22:54:47 IST 2016,@Swmnfool218 Indeed. That would make you an idiot. Choose your own candidate. For your own reason.
YNB,Sat Feb 27 22:53:17 IST 2016,"And that's why I block freely. I believe we can respectfully disagree. I don't tolerate rudeness. And newsflash, neither should you. xoxo"
YNB,Sat Feb 27 22:52:08 IST 2016,"This is about your process and your right. I'm vocal, because I want you to educate yourself and use your one vote wisely."
YNB,Sat Feb 27 22:49:03 IST 2016,"My hope is that in your research, someone will inspire you. So that when you vote it is on purpose and with purpose. That is my only goal."
YNB,Sat Feb 27 22:47:51 IST 2016,Don't get distracted by the mayhem inherent in this particular political season. It is all about YOU and your #OneVote. #ItCountsItMatters
YNB,Sat Feb 27 22:46:02 IST 2016,Those who have asked for my reasons #ImWithHer have missed the point. I'm not trying to sway you. I've done my research & chosen. #DoTheSame
YNB,Sat Feb 27 22:23:04 IST 2016,"@tyler_mcgowen I have researched everyone, watched every debate on both sides & she's my choice. My reasons aren't important YOUR choice is."
YNB,Sat Feb 27 22:19:39 IST 2016,@frazer_caryn And we all get our one vote. My goal in tweeting about this is for everyone to use their voice. Hopefully choosing wisely.
YNB,Sat Feb 27 22:18:42 IST 2016,@frazer_caryn Lots of things go into my voting decisions. My process is mine. The blessing is we all get to decide in our own way.
YNB,Sat Feb 27 22:18:10 IST 2016,"@frazer_caryn After that, temperament is key. Is the person hothead? Are they arrogant? Narcissistic? Not good traits in a President etc..."
YNB,Sat Feb 27 22:16:46 IST 2016,"@frazer_caryn After that, does the person have the ability & knowledge of how DC works to get things done is number 2."
YNB,Sat Feb 27 22:15:52 IST 2016,@frazer_caryn There are things that every politician does that gives me pause. I choose based on various things. Caring for people is # 1...
YNB,Sat Feb 27 22:14:45 IST 2016,@RoseEchoes It's not for the faint of heart. Lol!
YNB,Sat Feb 27 22:10:30 IST 2016,@rae9113 I respect your right to your choice. #ImWithHer
YNB,Sat Feb 27 22:09:58 IST 2016,"Know this, encouraging you all to engage in the political process is worth any rude response I may get. Get informed. Get involved. #Vote"
YNB,Sat Feb 27 22:07:09 IST 2016,@coreynolan22 It's cool Corey. You take care
YNB,Sat Feb 27 22:06:40 IST 2016,@AndyJMacc I respect your respectful disagreement. I'm just glad you're engaged in the process. We all should be.
YNB,Sat Feb 27 21:59:49 IST 2016,"@Its_Brundon Thanks, hun! And I respect yours! ðŸ˜Š"
YNB,Sat Feb 27 21:59:08 IST 2016,@Ian_Schmidtmann Oh no! How will I ever go on?! Just kidding. I'll be fine. ðŸ˜Š
YNB,Sat Feb 27 21:58:27 IST 2016,@LilyYeahh I'm not. Just sharing my views on my page. Feel free to do the same.
YNB,Sat Feb 27 21:56:15 IST 2016,To those I have blocked & will apparently be blocking for the next hour or so. I guess the request for a respectful election season is a no?
YNB,Sat Feb 27 21:54:15 IST 2016,"@coreynolan22 Thanks for letting me know you meant no disrespect. From that tweet, I couldn't tell."
YNB,Sat Feb 27 21:53:31 IST 2016,@AgentDanaDunham Keep reading my feed. Disrespect is the shame. We can be kind to each other whomever we support. Remember that.
YNB,Sat Feb 27 21:52:33 IST 2016,"In fact, you should be researching every candidate in each party. Somebody will be our new President. Best to know who's running things. ðŸ˜Š"
YNB,Sat Feb 27 21:51:36 IST 2016,"More than anything, whomever you support please make sure you're registered & vote. & if you're unclear on who's who, do your research..."
YNB,Sat Feb 27 21:49:53 IST 2016,"As with every election, I have faith that we can respectfully discuss our hopes for our country without name calling and hatefulness."
YNB,Sat Feb 27 21:48:47 IST 2016,"I wanted to be clear about who has my vote because I believe in @HillaryClinton. That said, I respect that others may support another..."
YNB,Sat Feb 27 21:47:43 IST 2016,"RT @HillaryClinton: Todayâ€™s the day! As South Carolina heads to the polls, let Hillary know you're with her. #ImWithHer https://t.co/Cg9B4bâ€¦"
YNB,Sat Feb 27 21:47:18 IST 2016,.@HillaryClinton won my vote when I was in college. One speech while campaigning for @BillClinton & I knew when the time comes #ImWithHer!
YNB,Sat Feb 27 20:40:18 IST 2016,Welp. She sho' can sing and write a beautiful song. She is @singkirby. Meet this voice.â€¦ https://t.co/E19YnsZWb8
