dimitrigeorga,Wed Feb 24 06:34:03 IST 2016,@LeBatardShow that's just shockiller! Show benefits from having a crotchety old man whine how things aren't like they were in his day lol
dimitrigeorga,Wed Feb 24 05:16:26 IST 2016,@JakeElman @MLBtheShow_Tips if that's the case I will be trading every one with awful facial hair to the Marlins. Will be fun
dimitrigeorga,Wed Feb 24 04:44:11 IST 2016,@MLBtheShow_Tips another reason to love the game lol
dimitrigeorga,Wed Feb 24 04:38:17 IST 2016,@Steve_OS probably a good thing for me. I don't think I'd ever finish a game before running out of players who were ejected
dimitrigeorga,Tue Feb 23 21:48:00 IST 2016,@PeteAbe just love that sound. Ready for spring!

dimitrigeorga,Thu Feb 18 17:23:11 IST 2016,@Inc connection to leadership ability?  Really insightful #sarcasm. I'm pretty sure quality sleep is related to everything no study required
dimitrigeorga,Tue Feb 16 19:11:58 IST 2016,@CNN you know what is proven to significantly reduce the risk of childhood obesity more?  Setting a healthy lifestyle example for your child
dimitrigeorga,Tue Feb 16 19:07:08 IST 2016,@jonmorosi you're everywhere. Just saw a segment with you on MLB. Must mean spring is around the corner. Bring on ⚾️
dimitrigeorga,Tue Feb 16 19:00:21 IST 2016,@CNN incredible the amount of garbage on this topic. How about just simplifying life by eating a well balanced diet & getting exercise?
dimitrigeorga,Tue Feb 16 04:54:32 IST 2016,@PeterMeiszner wow!  You just can't make this stuff up. Queue the outsourcing jokes
dimitrigeorga,Tue Feb 16 04:52:01 IST 2016,@CR you mean that ad with Canada in the background?
dimitrigeorga,Tue Feb 16 00:28:50 IST 2016,@richarddeitsch thanks for always recommending interesting pieces. Like that you share from diff perspectives and ideologies
dimitrigeorga,Mon Feb 15 22:25:02 IST 2016,@awfulannouncing but only if he is permitted at least 2 product placements per segment eg a papa johns blazer and bud neck tie

dimitrigeorga,Tue Feb 09 07:20:34 IST 2016,@CP24 come again? what was the name of that storm in England?
dimitrigeorga,Mon Feb 08 18:37:57 IST 2016,"Congratulations on a great season @ChrisWesseling. Enjoyed your insights and the podcasts. And thank you for correcting the ""coup"" pet peeve"
dimitrigeorga,Mon Feb 08 08:06:58 IST 2016,This game is more like a Thursday night game early in the season then the 2 best teams In #SB50
dimitrigeorga,Mon Feb 08 06:16:18 IST 2016,@MarcSesslerNFL incredible closing speed. Like a turbo button on Madden
dimitrigeorga,Mon Feb 08 06:12:37 IST 2016,This is definitely the end for Peyton. There's really nothing left in his arm. He'll be lucky to escape without a couple INTs #SB50
dimitrigeorga,Fri Feb 05 06:25:46 IST 2016,@mental_floss that's so unbelievable!  You could have convinced me it was a gag that's how unreal it is
dimitrigeorga,Thu Feb 04 23:13:19 IST 2016,"@darrenrovell everyone needs to calm down about this. Remember they are in entertainment business like WWE there's a ""villain"" for everyone"
dimitrigeorga,Thu Feb 04 21:25:41 IST 2016,"@WSJ talks a big game about how powerful and rich he is but when the heat is on he turtles. Typifies the type of ""leadership"" these days"
dimitrigeorga,Thu Feb 04 21:18:57 IST 2016,@MLBtheShow_Tips this truly is awesome sauce!  Bring on the spring
dimitrigeorga,Wed Feb 03 02:30:46 IST 2016,Everyone needs to visit @Chillicehouse   Pretty er... Cool experience (I bet I'm the 1000th person to say that pun) #Toronto
dimitrigeorga,Mon Feb 01 20:17:39 IST 2016,@darrenrovell clearly this is to appeal to the casual fan to try & reinforce how football is family rather than concussions and scandals
dimitrigeorga,Sun Jan 17 04:11:59 IST 2016,I always wait for what Mike Carey says and then expect the opposite to be the ruling #KCvsNE

dimitrigeorga,Mon Jan 11 05:49:55 IST 2016,@greggrosenthal and Rodgers got that look like he's feeling it again a la early season. Things are going to get interesting
dimitrigeorga,Sun Jan 10 06:47:07 IST 2016,What a difference in broadcast crews going from Gruden/Tirico to Simms/Nantz. Like going from Brady at QB to Hoyer #PITvsCIN
dimitrigeorga,Sun Jan 10 06:41:47 IST 2016,Happy #Wesstivus to one and all!  May all your passes be long touchdowns and your defence impenetrable Fa-la-la-la @ChrisWesseling
dimitrigeorga,Fri Jan 08 19:26:54 IST 2016,You did a great job with the podcast. Really impressed. Keep up the great work. @ColleenWolfeNFL
dimitrigeorga,Thu Jan 07 01:51:23 IST 2016,@GlobeBobRyan was this parked in your drafts for a couple months and you just hit tweet by mistake?
dimitrigeorga,Mon Jan 04 06:56:23 IST 2016,@MarcSesslerNFL @RapSheet This means the other coaching staff not that he fired them over email. Still a conf call at least for them though
dimitrigeorga,Mon Jan 04 06:51:03 IST 2016,@ESPNStatsInfo what's that AP?  You're feeling a little under the weather. Maybe you should be deactivated and rest up for next week
dimitrigeorga,Sun Jan 03 00:09:04 IST 2016,Well it was a great game. Congrats to the Fins!  Disappointed in this team this year. Not that they lost but how they played #CANvsFIN
dimitrigeorga,Sun Jan 03 00:03:11 IST 2016,Come on!  That was a power play. Really undisciplined play on this team. Disappointed. Gotta overcome and show heart to tie it up #CANvsFIN
dimitrigeorga,Sun Jan 03 00:00:11 IST 2016,Okay!  Time for final push. Tie it up Can. Let's get some free hockey and settle it in OT for this fun game. #CANvsFIN
dimitrigeorga,Sat Jan 02 23:57:54 IST 2016,It's hard to win this tourney when your older players don't show leadership and undisciplined and not your best. But not over! #CANvsFIN
dimitrigeorga,Sat Jan 02 23:40:14 IST 2016,Wow!  Not sure my heart can take this anymore LOL. Kind of game fans love and coaches hate. What a game! Go CANADA! #CANvsFIN
dimitrigeorga,Sat Jan 02 23:34:28 IST 2016,Nice goal CAN!  No matter what happens we're in for a great 3td period. I smell overtime. Go Canada! #CANvsFIN
dimitrigeorga,Sat Jan 02 23:06:05 IST 2016,Great game!  Now show how we play with heart. There is still more twists and turns to go. Stay mentally strong #CANvsFIN
dimitrigeorga,Sat Jan 02 22:44:46 IST 2016,What a game!  Gotta keep up the pressure forecheck. Fins defence have trouble moving puck and now a goalie change!  Whoa! #CANvsFIN
dimitrigeorga,Sat Jan 02 22:37:16 IST 2016,Game on!  I think we all knew the Fins were better then what they showed earlier. Stay strong and be mentally tough Can boys #CANvsFIN
dimitrigeorga,Sat Jan 02 22:10:40 IST 2016,It's okay. Don't let that get them down. Great period aside from that. Long game. Go Can! #CANvsFIN
dimitrigeorga,Sat Jan 02 22:07:24 IST 2016,Totally different team.  Wow!  Fins are shell shocked in their own rink. They look lost #CANvsFIN
dimitrigeorga,Thu Dec 24 02:15:30 IST 2015,@BleacherNation you used to be obsessed & now you've gone full Cubs insane.Santa can't make season start earlier but did bring you Heyward.
dimitrigeorga,Tue Dec 22 05:17:06 IST 2015,@BleacherReport hope my wife doesn't see that. That's the pattern of the flannel pyjamas I got her for Christmas.
