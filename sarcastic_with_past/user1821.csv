joshauck,Mon Feb 29 06:19:57 IST 2016,Watching Michael Strahan force Tina Fey into a selfie has never been presented so classily. #Oscars #sarcasm
joshauck,Mon Feb 29 06:17:08 IST 2016,"In the same room as people watching the #Oscars, I've never seen so many 'famous' people that I had forgotten exist."
joshauck,Sun Feb 28 23:55:19 IST 2016,@YahooNoise Mostly agree. Concerned about ceiling if they run into a talented team that happens to execute
joshauck,Sun Feb 28 23:45:04 IST 2016,@YahooNoise They aren't talented enough to win without superior execution. Sort of like a poor man's Wichita St?
joshauck,Sat Feb 27 07:21:39 IST 2016,"@scott_pianowski Him, Cousins, and Harden are the big 3 of whining. Also, the Clips as a collective unit."
joshauck,Sat Feb 27 00:04:03 IST 2016,@FantasyDouche Not a lot of evidence he can hang onto entry passes to the post from the tape I've seen
joshauck,Fri Feb 26 23:13:05 IST 2016,"Now he just needs to learn how to catch, pass block, and run behind a line that isn't miles better than the opponent https://t.co/jBShCSrdmG"
joshauck,Fri Feb 26 08:09:56 IST 2016,"@RoFlo He'd probably say that the current president should appoint, but would no doubt find fault in many potential candidates."
joshauck,Thu Feb 25 22:38:17 IST 2016,"How deep would your dynasty roster need to be to add T-Rich? 40 man? 60?

#fantasy #DynastyFootball"
joshauck,Thu Feb 25 08:58:27 IST 2016,"To my eyes, Dunleavy coming back fixed a lot of #Bulls issues. He doesn't allow the defense to readjust bc he moves the ball so quickly"
joshauck,Thu Feb 25 08:37:05 IST 2016,"@WilliamsonNFL Benjamin, Gordon, 1.06, Martin, Ingram, Lacy? Concerned about Ingram injury, think Lacy looks beyond bad."
joshauck,Thu Feb 25 08:15:53 IST 2016,"This is the best offensive game I've seen the #Bulls play, it might be that the system works and Rose/Butler have been weighing them down."
joshauck,Wed Feb 24 07:02:11 IST 2016,@YahooNoise It looks like they're obstacles in a particularly unoriginal laser-tag course...
joshauck,Tue Feb 23 09:37:19 IST 2016,I don't think there's a #WWE fan over the age of 12 wants that wants Roman Reigns to beat @TripleH this #WrestleMania after that performance
joshauck,Tue Feb 23 09:30:54 IST 2016,Anything involving the #BigShow long ago descended into unintentional comedy. #RAW #WWE
joshauck,Mon Feb 22 07:34:13 IST 2016,Is this REALLY what they want for WM? This feud? Really? #WWEFastlane #WrestleMania
joshauck,Mon Feb 22 06:37:14 IST 2016,@ByronSaxton looks like a poorly constructed CGI rendering of an actual person. #WWEFastlane #WWE
joshauck,Sat Feb 20 23:57:54 IST 2016,"I'm sure that this was well intentioned, but it feels more embarrassing than just getting blown out. #basketball  https://t.co/AYUDolHaAj"
joshauck,Thu Feb 18 23:48:29 IST 2016,"Why the trade for Frye? It seems like the #Cavs shouldn't be interested in a worse Love, and this certainly doesn't help them guard the dubs"
joshauck,Sat Feb 13 04:02:54 IST 2016,"@WilliamsonNFL That's sort of where I had settled too, thanks for the advice. BTW, thoroughly enjoying the new podcast"
joshauck,Sat Feb 13 03:41:46 IST 2016,"@WilliamsonNFL Should have mentioned it's also PPR, but does that make a significant enough difference?"
joshauck,Sat Feb 13 03:27:22 IST 2016,@WilliamsonNFL Was offered Gurley for L Bell straight up. What's my play?
joshauck,Sat Feb 13 00:42:16 IST 2016,"@WaddleandSilvy In no particular order: Cade McNown, Ced Benson, Johnnie Knox, Kellen Davis, J'Marcus Webb, and the immortal Chris Conte"
joshauck,Tue Feb 09 21:47:05 IST 2016,"To be fair to Cam, he has also shown is an extremely poor sport when he wins, so you have to admire the consistency. #CamNewton"
joshauck,Tue Feb 09 10:01:03 IST 2016,#ThankYouDanielBryan for making me care so deeply about something so silly.
joshauck,Tue Feb 09 04:50:39 IST 2016,"@RoFlo And it seems like Kerr picked up a lot more from Pop, he certainly isn't running a triangle..."
joshauck,Tue Feb 09 04:46:57 IST 2016,"Thank you @WWEDanielBryan, after years away you were the one that brought me back into wrestling. #ThankYouDanielBryan"

joshauck,Mon Feb 08 07:47:32 IST 2016,"That's a drop, right? #SB50 #propbets"
joshauck,Mon Feb 08 07:32:46 IST 2016,@NateRavitz They would be throwing to Jericho Cotchery more...
joshauck,Mon Feb 08 07:21:10 IST 2016,"@AdamSpankyEaton Nothing wrong with the halftime show, it's just more fun to hate it"
joshauck,Mon Feb 08 07:08:36 IST 2016,Did anyone tell Coldplay this was happening? #SB50 #PepsiHalftime
joshauck,Mon Feb 08 06:08:28 IST 2016,A 4 yard difference seems like a silly use of your final challenge. #KeepPounding #SB50
joshauck,Mon Feb 08 05:47:36 IST 2016,"Cotchery having a bad game so far, 2 peewee level drops, maybe he switched numbers with Tedd Ginn... #SB50"
joshauck,Mon Feb 08 05:39:32 IST 2016,"@WaddleandSilvy But that was clearly incomplete, nose of the ball hits the ground and it shifts as he rolls over.... #SB50"
joshauck,Mon Feb 08 03:03:05 IST 2016,It's an injustice that Timber's second TD was taken away! #VoteTimber #PuppyBowl
joshauck,Mon Feb 08 01:08:35 IST 2016,The Puppy Bowl just took a shot at Brian Williams? #PuppyBowl #NBCNightlyNews
joshauck,Mon Feb 08 01:03:59 IST 2016,Serious question: are the Puppy Bowl announcers better than the CBS team? #PuppyBowl #SuperBowl
joshauck,Sun Feb 07 23:49:33 IST 2016,"@ProFootballDoc Still though, skull fractures aren't a good thing either and this is an easy fix for the NFL"
joshauck,Sat Feb 06 09:14:46 IST 2016,"@WaddleandSilvy Knee ligament injuries are by definition sprains, but it would seem to indicate no ACL because that is easily diagnosed live"
joshauck,Sat Feb 06 09:11:14 IST 2016,"Bulls training staff is a real issue. It can happen to anyone once, but they screwed up Lu, Jo, and Rose. Butler a coincidence? #Bulls"
joshauck,Sat Feb 06 00:40:22 IST 2016,At some point you need to think about penalizing the coaches as well as the programs. You know Pitino will run to greener pastures #UofL
joshauck,Tue Feb 02 07:20:17 IST 2016,"The #SocialOutcasts are like if Michael Scott was a tag team, all over the place and hard to watch. #RAW"
joshauck,Mon Feb 01 06:41:22 IST 2016,"Rice should call the throw an interception, force a fumble, and recover it play again! #NFLProBowl2016 #ProBowl"
joshauck,Mon Feb 01 04:59:29 IST 2016,John Scott has the highest percentage of career goals scored in the all star game. @ESPNStatsInfo #NHLAllStar
joshauck,Mon Feb 01 03:31:45 IST 2016,"These teams are close, but it's eye-opening to see just how much better Pau is than Deandre Jordan. #clippers #bulls #CHIatLAC"
joshauck,Tue Jan 26 21:48:53 IST 2016,Did he whine about a foul not being called afterwards? #BlakeGriffin #Clippers https://t.co/h9tTpd0sik
joshauck,Mon Jan 25 05:45:16 IST 2016,"The RB playing QB thing is becoming a disservice to Cam, he's a real QB who's at least league average from the pocket #AZvsCAR #KeepPounding"
joshauck,Mon Jan 25 04:47:28 IST 2016,Gronk whine! #DoYourJob
joshauck,Mon Jan 25 04:44:38 IST 2016,"Terrible challenge, might have been a catch but definitely not a fumble. #NEvsDEN #BroncosCountryPlayoffs"
