Ant_on_sticks,Sun Feb 21 21:37:33 IST 2016,@PNF4LYFE withdrawal. Lol. Played some Madden today. It helped.
Ant_on_sticks,Tue Feb 16 04:02:09 IST 2016,@PNF4LYFE @The_CrapGamer @Mooch1978 it didn't take QB for me to see the vision. I saw it I'm the OG Xbox. Luv it. https://t.co/1QrHucpKLl
Ant_on_sticks,Mon Feb 15 22:59:18 IST 2016,@PNF4LYFE I got the Halo reach 360 but this time skipped Halo box. I want a Gears box. Black so its somewhat Adult looking.

Ant_on_sticks,Mon Feb 15 06:08:35 IST 2016,@ATOMICAUST @PNF4LYFE its a must see. Even if you have never read the comics. Awesome flix.
Ant_on_sticks,Mon Feb 15 04:15:50 IST 2016,@PNF4LYFE @The_CrapGamer seem it earlier. Stopped reading after crappy gamer. Shit is funny though.
Ant_on_sticks,Sun Feb 14 03:00:10 IST 2016,@PNF4LYFE good. That would defeat their purpose. So the QB coming to PC is null. All hoopla. Back to my backlog before @TheDivisionGame drop
Ant_on_sticks,Sun Feb 14 02:48:15 IST 2016,@The_CrapGamer @DoubleSDoubleD1 @MayorKacho @PNF4LYFE @realboyz02 groove music would be nice. But it would have to be at a reduced price.
Ant_on_sticks,Sat Feb 13 07:33:53 IST 2016,@The_CrapGamer standard = packed in with console. Got it.
Ant_on_sticks,Sat Feb 13 07:03:33 IST 2016,@The_CrapGamer so you got a PC to run those xb1/Windows games? I'll guess not. Like most console gamers. Right? I maybe wrong.

Ant_on_sticks,Fri Feb 12 23:17:56 IST 2016,@bdp2007 @Windows @Xbox @XboxP3 #Gamers yeah that got lost in the YouTube crumbside of things. We gotta get on that @TheDivisionGame 3/8.
Ant_on_sticks,Fri Feb 12 23:09:41 IST 2016,@bdp2007 @Windows @Xbox @XboxP3 windows 10 a Microsoft product. Sad state that some gamers are in man.
Ant_on_sticks,Fri Feb 12 23:06:29 IST 2016,@PNF4LYFE @The_CrapGamer losing it to windows 10? You know people were waiting to get at crap. Those media sites mad him look bad. Let it go
Ant_on_sticks,Fri Feb 12 23:02:59 IST 2016,@jameron4eva @The_CrapGamer @XboxP3 smh. Sad thought process.
Ant_on_sticks,Fri Feb 12 22:54:34 IST 2016,@bdp2007 @Windows @Xbox @XboxP3 because it doesn't feed into their perpetuation of this console war. Who complains about getting more?
Ant_on_sticks,Fri Feb 12 18:33:19 IST 2016,@andyxleedsutdx @The_CrapGamer then you can't go wrong. P.C gaming is not for me. But the option to play (Win/âˆ—M.Sâˆ—or Xb1) is a plus.
Ant_on_sticks,Fri Feb 12 17:32:02 IST 2016,@The_CrapGamer @Life_is_Xbox comedian. I don't care how my games are delivered.It's about the games 2 me.Give a box/flash w/ a game store.
Ant_on_sticks,Fri Feb 12 17:12:39 IST 2016,@Life_is_Xbox @The_CrapGamer #LifeisGaming it should have always been about gaming!
Ant_on_sticks,Fri Feb 12 17:11:25 IST 2016,@andyxleedsutdx @The_CrapGamer #xboxone #windows10 windows/xb1 its all the same. What's the issue? Why complain about more.
Ant_on_sticks,Fri Feb 12 16:24:28 IST 2016,@ortell22 @The_CrapGamer my xbox1 now is an app. I don't even use the damn disc tray. Give me a windows box. As long as I can play the GAMES
Ant_on_sticks,Fri Feb 12 16:20:43 IST 2016,@jameron4eva @The_CrapGamer @XboxP3 how are you stabbed in the back? Bought all xboxes day one. And I don't see it as an issue. SMH
Ant_on_sticks,Fri Feb 12 06:52:15 IST 2016,@XboxP3 Cross buy is awesome. Xbox gamer primarily but the option is great.
Ant_on_sticks,Fri Feb 12 05:40:23 IST 2016,@Mooch1978 the funny thing is his money is still going to Microsoft. SMH. Some people. Software makes money.
