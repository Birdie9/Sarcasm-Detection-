BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 02:52:16 IST 2016,Eric Staal would have scored that #sarcasm
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 02:38:45 IST 2016,I can see us doing something so out of left field like getting Shattenkirk opposed to getting Staal way too many rumors going around Staal
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 02:34:42 IST 2016,Seguin and Benn have 64 goals combined what the Holy hell
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 02:33:44 IST 2016,@kennylbelvin that was my reaction too I was like wtf
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 02:30:56 IST 2016,@NYR30_ these are the types of trades we should be making Hudler was a steal a 2nd and a 4th in 3 drafts from now
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 02:29:08 IST 2016,@NYR30_ what the hell did they trade for kindl
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 02:28:53 IST 2016,I was expecting to see Marc playing with Eric by deadline not this way though. I wanted Eric on the team like 5 years ago not now
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 02:21:43 IST 2016,I love how Ranger fans are just expecting the inevitable of seeing E.Staal in a Rangers jersey Monday. It's a really bad sign for an Org
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 02:19:50 IST 2016,@kennylbelvin they also got that Hunt kid tjat was a free agent
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 02:18:45 IST 2016,I have a really bad feeling in the pit of my stomach that Rangers are going to do something extremely stupid worse than Duclair last year
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 02:17:01 IST 2016,The only way I trade Kreider Lindberg and Skjei is if they give us staal and skinner and eat half of skinners contract
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 02:13:45 IST 2016,@Willc22 Eric staal for something involving Kreider supposedly
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 02:12:57 IST 2016,@bizarrospeak @DennisTFP same
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 02:11:09 IST 2016,@BlueSeatBlogs yandle last year was out of left field we heard about Marty
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 02:10:21 IST 2016,Wouldn't couldn't trade for Purcell either for a 3rd round pick what is wrong with the Rangers why must you insist on giving up roster piece
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 01:59:32 IST 2016,I'm not sure why Rangers need a goalie unless we are trading Hank.
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 01:53:13 IST 2016,@TheRealNiko21 @BlueshirtMac19 same exact feeling
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 01:52:38 IST 2016,@rangersofny @amshockey96 didn't it come the day of the deadline
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 01:52:09 IST 2016,@TheRealNiko21 I'm not sure why you doubted it to begin witj
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 01:47:42 IST 2016,@kevinbaumer okay then I've heard like 4 different things
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 01:46:26 IST 2016,@Yandlebaum depends on your opinion on Eric staal
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 01:46:02 IST 2016,@kevinbaumer rangers have 5m in cap come Monday and both their contracts are probably like 4m combined
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 01:43:31 IST 2016,@kevinbaumer or Versteeg
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 01:40:55 IST 2016,Excuse me a 4th round pick from THREE DRAFTS FROM NOW the Rangers couldn't do that for Hudler
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 01:38:56 IST 2016,If the only move the Rangers make is replacing Raanta they are in massive trouble also they have terrible understanding of what they need
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 01:34:19 IST 2016,@Yandlebaum you forgot Stepan Nash and Hayes
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 01:33:52 IST 2016,"RT @Yandlebaum: Hudler for a second?

ERIC STAAL FOR LINDBERG, BUCHNEVICH, LUNDQVIST, BRASSARD AND 85 1STS

BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 01:21:15 IST 2016,@bizarrospeak that is probably what Carolina started with
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 01:16:31 IST 2016,Carolina wants Kreider and Lindberg/Skjei Rangers don't be dumb that is way too much of this year/next year to give up.

BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 00:10:31 IST 2016,@MattHanzz @Josh_Khalfin palmeri would have made a more sense he was nhl tested not flip flopped like Etem

BlueshirtMac19,Sat Feb 27 22:58:43 IST 2016,@DunnyBabes why would we do that that is so counter productive
BlueshirtMac19,Sat Feb 27 22:57:57 IST 2016,If we are giving Canes Kreider+ for Staal we are dumb if it's Kreider + more for Staal+Skinner then I would start listening.
BlueshirtMac19,Sat Feb 27 22:53:00 IST 2016,@BroadwayPete2 @BlueshirtMac19 @NYR30_ it depends on what it is
BlueshirtMac19,Sat Feb 27 22:51:19 IST 2016,"If we get Staal he better produce plain and simple we are going to lose Yandle,E.Staal one of Hayes,Miller or Kreider if they aren't traded"
BlueshirtMac19,Sat Feb 27 22:47:27 IST 2016,I hope Yandle is actually off the market and he isn't traded for Staal I'd be so upset if that were the case
BlueshirtMac19,Sat Feb 27 22:45:26 IST 2016,@BlkNBlueShirts @rangersreport only difference is they'll be kicked in 1st round I hope
BlueshirtMac19,Sat Feb 27 22:41:58 IST 2016,@BroadwayPete2 @NYR30_ @BlueshirtMac19 you always have to think of now and the future unless you are Chicago for some reason
BlueshirtMac19,Sat Feb 27 22:39:34 IST 2016,@msilvers1979 @BroadwayPete2 Chris Kreider probably cause rangers are dumb
BlueshirtMac19,Sat Feb 27 22:38:25 IST 2016,@MannyOWar a couple of people have said it this morning
BlueshirtMac19,Sat Feb 27 22:37:49 IST 2016,Why does Laich make so much money I'd pick him up right away if he made like 2-3 less
BlueshirtMac19,Sat Feb 27 22:36:26 IST 2016,@BlueSeatBlogs I'm sorry someone needed to haha
BlueshirtMac19,Sat Feb 27 22:35:23 IST 2016,@BlueSeatBlogs could this be a staal tactic
BlueshirtMac19,Sat Feb 27 22:34:56 IST 2016,Ughhhhhhh don't trade Kreider for Staal it's a terrible mistake Kreider is a consistent 20 goal scorer
BlueshirtMac19,Sat Feb 27 22:33:10 IST 2016,@amshockey96 4 of them
