bmetzer,Sat Feb 13 04:29:49 IST 2016,Common objection is that we don't live it well enough to be efficacious. Why are we so confident we preach it well enough?

bmetzer,Thu Jan 28 04:02:50 IST 2016,@loveservegrow which I have. But this whole rant may be less about Jesus for rhe than she herself claims. Self-examination across the board
bmetzer,Thu Jan 28 03:03:00 IST 2016,@loveservegrow @chrisbeggs @rachelheldevans @ahc let her apply it uniformly then not just against the right. That's my point.
