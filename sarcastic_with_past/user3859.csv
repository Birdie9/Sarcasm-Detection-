Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 18:26:57 IST 2015,"Great Easter day with family.. Now only 27 days to Kentucky Derby, 41 days to Preakness, 62 days to Belmont, 110 day to Saratoga Opening Day"
Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 07:24:31 IST 2015,@DanonymousMan Lightly raced getting better each race and was off 6 moths which helped him not get Pletchered…..
Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 07:17:48 IST 2015,"@DanonymousMan American Pharaoh, Dortmund, Carpe Diem, Materiality & Stanford"
Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 07:06:11 IST 2015,@travfourr @SeaBass912 I did use the firster. The 5 and the 6 were horrible on sheets and you didn't need a big # to win D'mato 18% Firster
Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 07:02:41 IST 2015,@SeaBass912 @travfourr The life we choose… We'll get them this week.. Back to the salt mine tomorrow and start preparing for next weekend
Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 06:59:53 IST 2015,@SeaBass912 not life changing money but some more money to make wagers this week.
Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 06:59:05 IST 2015,@SeaBass912 I know. I pushed a $ 6.00 ticket 5 times and went 3 out of 4. My frustration not only with 3 but with the 8 losing by a head.
Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 06:50:19 IST 2015,@SeaBass912 You are a better man than I. I am still pissed off… LOL...
Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 06:49:12 IST 2015,@bellringerwins On sheets he is slow but haven't seen his last number… He does everything right though.
Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 06:33:00 IST 2015,@bellringerwins and I think International Star is a bet against as well..
Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 06:32:20 IST 2015,"@bellringerwins I just think that the top three are so much better than the rest that it doesn't matter. Dortmund, Carpe Diem & American Pha"
Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 06:29:10 IST 2015,"@brooklyncowboy1 Kevin I am pretty sure you don't need to even worry about who the jockey is on El Kabeir, he is already a toss."
Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 06:24:45 IST 2015,@bellringerwins I could see that more than any of the others listed but I just don't think he is good enough.
Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 06:19:41 IST 2015,"Is any1 on twitter backing these horses in KD for the win? Frosted, El Kabeir, Tencendur, Ocho Ocho Ocho, Danzing Moon?"
Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 05:59:04 IST 2015,If the steelers take the OLB from Kentucky (Dupree) I will immediately sell everything I own of theirs and root for the Jets. #idiotcoach
Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 04:42:04 IST 2015,Berajano nine wide the entire race makes a big move and then flattens out. No shit when you are 9 wide the entire race.
Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 04:34:54 IST 2015,@fatbaldguyracin @Shapperdacapper Happy Easter to you both...
Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 04:00:14 IST 2015,@travfourr I have had it happen to me and yes not always but I don't get it often either.
Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 01:58:30 IST 2015,@GIACOMO421 Happy Easter to you and the family...
Dmoney1568,Sun Apr 05 21:30:02 IST 2015,@Raps7 the pens are horrible. I am a huge fan of them but I call it like I see it. Horrible...
Dmoney1568,Sun Apr 05 21:21:19 IST 2015,@DanonymousMan happy Easter to you and your family Dan!!!
Dmoney1568,Sun Apr 05 21:18:48 IST 2015,@Dmrsurfside happy Easter to you and your family!!!

Dmoney1568,Sun Apr 05 09:42:04 IST 2015,@Shapperdacapper I blame the refs for me not hitting the Woodbine super high five.. Total BS.. :)
Dmoney1568,Sun Apr 05 09:36:24 IST 2015,On Monday can we fast forward to Saturday so we can back on the derby trail…. LOL...
Dmoney1568,Sun Apr 05 09:26:59 IST 2015,@JoeT_OnTheSide @Derbyologist Both of mine are gone.. Far from Over hurt and Prospect Park got Desormeaux'ed today… Best of Luck...
Dmoney1568,Sun Apr 05 09:21:36 IST 2015,@JoeT_OnTheSide Great idea. Do we know the expected runners for the Arkansas Derby? @Derbyologist usually has a pulse on that
Dmoney1568,Sun Apr 05 08:49:34 IST 2015,@brooklyncowboy1 numbers?
Dmoney1568,Sun Apr 05 08:48:39 IST 2015,Super High Five Numbers?
Dmoney1568,Sun Apr 05 08:43:54 IST 2015,@Shapperdacapper Congrats Scott.
Dmoney1568,Sun Apr 05 08:34:22 IST 2015,Total fucking joke this game is. Went from great game to BS..
Dmoney1568,Sun Apr 05 08:33:55 IST 2015,Flop Flop Flop...
Dmoney1568,Sun Apr 05 08:32:06 IST 2015,Payback right there.
Dmoney1568,Sun Apr 05 08:29:36 IST 2015,When Joshua My Boy lights up the tote board @WoodbineRacing We are bringing down the super high five @Barbaro1420
Dmoney1568,Sun Apr 05 08:04:53 IST 2015,Inside Inside go inside cats… They can't stop it...
Dmoney1568,Sun Apr 05 07:51:46 IST 2015,Every bounce and every call going to Wisconsin. Can't lose when that happens...
Dmoney1568,Sun Apr 05 07:26:10 IST 2015,Well 20 minutes has settled nothing. Nail biter. Enjoying watching knowing I can't lose anything… LOL...
Dmoney1568,Sun Apr 05 06:28:11 IST 2015,@BillyBlake22 congrats on your win today!!! Best of Luck!!!!
Dmoney1568,Sun Apr 05 05:08:20 IST 2015,@ThoroughbredAR @fatbaldguyracin @Zenyattaforever I agree.. It was a great day and time between races between tracks were perfect.
Dmoney1568,Sun Apr 05 04:20:20 IST 2015,How freaking bad is Desormeaux? 6 horse field and gets the horse in between and checks twice and then dives to rail. MORON!!!
Dmoney1568,Sun Apr 05 03:16:28 IST 2015,@jmanmetsfan1 @Dmrsurfside Best of Luck…
Dmoney1568,Sun Apr 05 02:43:50 IST 2015,@jmanmetsfan1 The guy in first in our Derby Wars is pushing all the right buttons..
Dmoney1568,Sun Apr 05 02:42:22 IST 2015,@chare889 Wow that was tough...
Dmoney1568,Sun Apr 05 02:40:58 IST 2015,"@chare889 I had him and the 10 who finished 4th in that race… March ran big but Lord Nelson, Wow that horse was a monster..."
Dmoney1568,Sun Apr 05 02:39:46 IST 2015,@SeaBass912 @jmanmetsfan1 Thanks...
Dmoney1568,Sun Apr 05 02:38:58 IST 2015,@MaxwinsRacing BS
Dmoney1568,Sun Apr 05 02:38:45 IST 2015,@SeaBass912 @jmanmetsfan1 Sorry bro… I am having a shitty day and hopefully it picks me up.
Dmoney1568,Sun Apr 05 02:36:35 IST 2015,"@jmanmetsfan1 @SeaBass912 Race riding. I had him to win in Derby Wars, The Huddie Pool. Win and place and in the pick 4."
Dmoney1568,Sun Apr 05 02:35:20 IST 2015,Thank you @chare889 I have been watching him ever since you mentioned him months ago.
