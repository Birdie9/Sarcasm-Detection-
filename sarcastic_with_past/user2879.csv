epberg,Mon Jun 22 08:42:00 IST 2015,@BobG231 Once the ball is rolling downhill it's hard to stop. It will be interesting how far it goes. For each white person--a yr in prison?
epberg,Sun Jun 21 23:49:52 IST 2015,"@Redone68 ""The church has spent 2000 years trying to treat the ills of human nature and yet those ills still persist."" H.W. Jenkins. WSJ."
epberg,Sun Jun 21 23:22:09 IST 2015,@JohnCornyn @GregJaffe You know why. It's because nothing has ever been denied to him in his life. Look at his life history. Always his way.
epberg,Sun Jun 21 22:06:52 IST 2015,"@yahisus @Redone68 Only to the person hearing it, unfortunately. But they add up. Eventually you have a movement. Then a government."
epberg,Sun Jun 21 22:04:41 IST 2015,"@Redone68 @yahisus It's called advertising, either for things or ideas. And it is very effective. And it costs money."
epberg,Sun Jun 21 21:59:43 IST 2015,@yahisus @Redone68 But haven't you heard that God has a plan for us all. I've heard that about 10K times. It must be true!
epberg,Sun Jun 21 20:25:21 IST 2015,@hale_razor @LadySandersfarm @ron_fournier It isn't a cause-and-effect issue. But only an association with meaning.
epberg,Sun Jun 21 20:23:15 IST 2015,@LadySandersfarm @ron_fournier But it can't be denied that the flag has two meanings. They can't be separated in the minds of many.
epberg,Sun Jun 21 17:57:30 IST 2015,@baxter_ted @SpreadButter Funny.
epberg,Sun Jun 21 05:23:39 IST 2015,"@Cmoyer I was going to say 5'3"" but then you would have thought I knew you!"
epberg,Sat Jun 20 22:14:21 IST 2015,"@CarmineZozzora I just realized we are in a giant, never-ending Ponzi scheme. The new money coming in is simply printed. Everyone is happy!"
epberg,Sat Jun 20 22:08:11 IST 2015,@CarmineZozzora For sure. But there may be no way back.
epberg,Sat Jun 20 22:07:02 IST 2015,@Conservative_VW Hardly anyone makes a 14 ft putt. Eagle or not. Be happy for the chance!
epberg,Sat Jun 20 22:05:14 IST 2015,@tkmforfreedom @CarmineZozzora I would believe 26K children world-wide. Not 260K. Only 36K people are killed/year in US.
epberg,Sat Jun 20 22:01:56 IST 2015,"@Cmoyer Let me guess: 5'4""."
epberg,Sat Jun 20 21:58:18 IST 2015,@CarmineZozzora Our debt will NEVER be repaid. We are living an unprecedented economic experiment: make-believe money and no inflation.
epberg,Sat Jun 20 21:51:39 IST 2015,"@MichelleFields @JonathanHoenig God, I wish they were. Dogs are innocent creatures that only want to be loved and cared for."
epberg,Sat Jun 20 21:50:42 IST 2015,"@CarmineZozzora Well, we are undergoing a great American experiment: can we spend all the $$ we want and not worry about the national debt."

epberg,Sat Jun 20 21:42:29 IST 2015,"@gerfingerpoken @ritzy_jewels The world knows we have elected a pacifist, non-confrontational president. Our enemies have nothing to fear."
epberg,Sat Jun 20 21:35:14 IST 2015,@BeladonnaRogers @JmbRieo08 @CarmineZozzora It's a vote-grabbing strategy. People vote for you if you tell them they are disadvantaged.
epberg,Sat Jun 20 20:33:59 IST 2015,@MarlaZEE All you have to do is visit New Orleans to see that.
epberg,Sat Jun 20 20:05:53 IST 2015,@DMashak It's nothing new. Banks borrow our money (debt). They then lend it to borrowers. That act creates money. I learned that in Econ 101
epberg,Sat Jun 20 19:57:33 IST 2015,@larryelder Racism against dark-skinned people exists world-wide. Have you read about the Dominicans deporting Haitians? Skin is darker.
epberg,Sat Jun 20 19:51:11 IST 2015,@AlysiaStern @davis1087 It's good to see a woman who is proud to be a woman. Refreshing.
epberg,Sat Jun 20 19:47:36 IST 2015,"@pinocchios If we don't help resolve the chaos in Syria, Somalia, Libya, Afghanistan, and Iraq, their people will be here. This can't be."
epberg,Sat Jun 20 19:43:54 IST 2015,@baxter_ted @SpreadButter America is infested with gun-wielding criminals. Now low-life religion-based terrorists. I am not naive.
epberg,Sat Jun 20 19:41:06 IST 2015,"@baxter_ted @SpreadButter But if the gov takes my guns, who is going to take the guns away from the criminals? I have them because of them."
epberg,Sat Jun 20 08:30:29 IST 2015,@pinocchios Did you know world-wide there are 60 million displaced immigrants looking for a new home? A very worrisome situation.
epberg,Sat Jun 20 08:28:28 IST 2015,@SpreadButter There's a message in that somewhere.
epberg,Sat Jun 20 04:34:51 IST 2015,@ScholarMrsV @LKrauss1 @Karo7878 or shod from nothing. The former is more likely. And everything follows from that. Case closed in my mind.
epberg,Sat Jun 20 04:33:37 IST 2015,@ScholarMrsV @LKrauss1 @Karo7878 I read it. It is way too complex to make his point. My view is much simpler. Either universe from nothing
epberg,Sat Jun 20 00:49:00 IST 2015,@pinocchios @jimcramer @WarrenBuffett Greed sometimes pays off. But mostly not. Slow and steady wins for most. Doing nothing can be the best
epberg,Fri Jun 19 21:13:22 IST 2015,@baxter_ted @SpreadButter No. But his suggesting that somehow America is unique among other countries is self-serving to gun-control agenda.
epberg,Fri Jun 19 21:10:19 IST 2015,@MeetAnimals @planetepics Get some tissues.
epberg,Fri Jun 19 21:03:42 IST 2015,@LadySandersfarm @Patriot762x51mm @BBCWorld He has no idea what he says. Off the cuff totally.
epberg,Fri Jun 19 21:02:49 IST 2015,@BAMAPERRY The chaos in the ME is having significant external effects. Obama has to help much more to stabilize the area.
epberg,Fri Jun 19 20:53:41 IST 2015,@AndreaTantaros @denniso15 We're all just one step away from needing a second chance.
epberg,Fri Jun 19 19:26:56 IST 2015,@TheMorningSpew @NRO People who become extremely rich think they are extremely smart and have the best ideas  about everything. Not true.
epberg,Fri Jun 19 10:19:39 IST 2015,@SpreadButter What the hell is an advanced country? He throws words around so much that I forgot I speak English.
epberg,Fri Jun 19 04:34:01 IST 2015,"@DanJoseph78 @CherylV33 I agree. But only to the extent that if there were no guns, no one would ever get shot. And no water, no drownings."
epberg,Fri Jun 19 04:28:18 IST 2015,@QuantumRealism @FunLifeGigHarbr @LukeTipoki People hear and see what they want to see and hear and disregard the rest. (From Paul Simon).
epberg,Fri Jun 19 03:50:51 IST 2015,@sujew11 @AnnCoulter Yep. But what Liberal doesn't? Including POTUS.
epberg,Fri Jun 19 03:48:13 IST 2015,@WhiteHouse @POTUS This comment had to be hacked. Our President could not have said this. Or even thought this. Middle East? Africa? Bosnia?
epberg,Fri Jun 19 03:48:13 IST 2015,"If the world were ""fair"", (the Liberal mantra) everyone would live in America. Is that what they want?"
epberg,Fri Jun 19 01:02:03 IST 2015,"@AnnCoulter Ann, I enjoy your comments. But people should get a second chance in life. He didn't commit a felony. Next time--done."
epberg,Thu Jun 18 21:40:58 IST 2015,"@PonderG We all have a point-of-view, don't we. That's why we go to the polls and vote."
epberg,Thu Jun 18 21:37:39 IST 2015,@ProGun2A @railboy63 If he had a machete the result would have been the same. Even more suffering.
epberg,Thu Jun 18 21:36:03 IST 2015,"@dyrbert @PonderG Are you surprised there are people who hate others because they are different (race, religion, country, etc)? Old story."
