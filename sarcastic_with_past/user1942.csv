JalehLShoghi,Sat Feb 27 23:20:39 IST 2016,@M_Hudson5 Absolutely gutted! Just wasn't happening for us! Well played (I'm now avoiding the Ipswich supporting boyfriend for a while)
JalehLShoghi,Sat Feb 27 23:01:01 IST 2016,@Jamie__1739 We just couldn't finish our chances another day would have been another score
