CharlesRoman,Wed Jun 24 23:32:16 IST 2015,"@roxaloxa Sure, the Red Bull thing is just a small drop in a large bucket. I found the interview to be even more off-putting."
CharlesRoman,Wed Jun 24 23:15:22 IST 2015,Sometimes I wonder if Bungie is running a social experiment on how much they can piss off users before they all leave.
CharlesRoman,Wed Jun 10 22:35:23 IST 2015,"@gibgib You can only make reparations by doing a favor for a ginger man, @ThePlutooo."
CharlesRoman,Thu Jun 04 09:10:21 IST 2015,@gasty It is interesting. The game takes quite a beastly computer though for only ok looking graphics.
CharlesRoman,Wed Jun 03 23:25:46 IST 2015,My work's first game is out on Steam Early Access! Everyone should take a look! https://t.co/rjGlnuCdDk
CharlesRoman,Tue May 26 20:49:30 IST 2015,@gibgib This actually looks like it could be a real scene after you decapitated her.
CharlesRoman,Sun May 24 03:13:40 IST 2015,Time to start #Witcher3!
CharlesRoman,Sat May 23 01:06:46 IST 2015,"@jillkolongowski Quick, go buy a sweater."
CharlesRoman,Fri May 22 22:44:13 IST 2015,"@brodiegames @Twitch @ThePlutooo Awesome! Sorry I saw this pretty late, should've looked at the time on it."
CharlesRoman,Fri May 22 22:41:53 IST 2015,@brodiegames @Twitch My friend works there. Can you help out @ThePlutooo?
CharlesRoman,Wed May 20 08:19:40 IST 2015,It has arrived! http://t.co/dvzumeCCil
CharlesRoman,Tue May 19 22:07:34 IST 2015,@Rick_Lesley New 970 GTX arrives today with Witcher and Batman. Excited to start playing!
CharlesRoman,Sat May 16 05:21:32 IST 2015,Just ordered a GeForce GTX 970 and got #Witcher3 and #BatmanArkhamKnight for free. #winning
CharlesRoman,Sat May 16 00:01:22 IST 2015,"@gibgib Yeah, I hear you there. CD Projekt has been doing this longer though, and aren't using Unity."
CharlesRoman,Fri May 15 23:57:04 IST 2015,"@gibgib ""Also pleasing: For Ultra-Details and Full HD all it takes is a middle-class graphics card such as a GTX 770 or R9 280X."""
CharlesRoman,Fri May 15 23:55:06 IST 2015,"@gibgib Video memory or CPU memory? They recommend a GTX 770/R9 290, so a card with 2GB of video memory should probably do fine."
CharlesRoman,Fri May 15 23:44:45 IST 2015,@gibgib Buy a new video card and get it for free! Plus Batman! http://t.co/HqibZgfpaF
CharlesRoman,Wed May 13 00:49:10 IST 2015,"Biking to work today I almost got hit 4 times, and my train was over an hour late. That means I got out all my bad luck for the week, right?"
CharlesRoman,Fri May 08 22:22:42 IST 2015,Saw a large pickup truck on the highway pulling a slightly smaller pickup truck. #America
CharlesRoman,Tue May 05 00:50:14 IST 2015,Seeing the British way of spelling words in code variables always makes me think someone had a typo. Defense/Defence.
CharlesRoman,Tue Apr 21 01:35:31 IST 2015,@ljharb From my very recent interview round I have some pretty terrible questions I was asked. Technical interviews are the worst.
CharlesRoman,Wed Apr 15 21:00:29 IST 2015,@brodiegames That seems like a weird scenario if they won and got the second seed. Warriors demolish OKC or Pelicans anyway.
CharlesRoman,Wed Apr 15 20:53:33 IST 2015,"You know, I guess I assumed San Francisco would have riding the train with a bike figured out. Turns out they don't."
CharlesRoman,Sat Apr 11 02:06:41 IST 2015,My friend @brodiegames released Hero Generations today! I'm super excited and everyone should pick it up! https://t.co/3viTdgMYMe
CharlesRoman,Tue Apr 07 03:39:39 IST 2015,@ThePlutooo We got their recommended plates plus a few extras so yeah blue crab roll was included and delicious!
CharlesRoman,Sun Apr 05 08:21:27 IST 2015,@ThePlutooo I have to say it is some of the best sushi we've ever had!
CharlesRoman,Sun Apr 05 07:05:17 IST 2015,@ThePlutooo We are having Sugarfish for dinner tonight. I'll let you know the verdict.
CharlesRoman,Fri Apr 03 21:18:05 IST 2015,Santa Monica for the weekend. Excited to get a chance to unwind. #randr
CharlesRoman,Thu Mar 26 00:16:40 IST 2015,Caltrain and I are becoming good buddies this week.
CharlesRoman,Mon Mar 23 21:45:44 IST 2015,@ThePlutooo DEMON
CharlesRoman,Fri Mar 20 20:02:02 IST 2015,Onsite with Anki today. I'm excited to see their robotic cars. Hopefully playing with them can be the interview.
CharlesRoman,Fri Mar 20 12:07:14 IST 2015,@gibgib Time to get a cat.
CharlesRoman,Wed Mar 18 11:09:02 IST 2015,@brodiegames Let me know when you figure that out.
CharlesRoman,Wed Mar 18 04:16:23 IST 2015,Had an interview today at 12:45. Emailed them at 1 because I hadn't got a call. It was an onsite interview and I hadn't been told. #whoops
CharlesRoman,Tue Mar 17 03:58:15 IST 2015,Recruiter e-mailed me back 10 minutes after I got off the phone with the engineer. #nailedit Now the fear inducing all day interview.
CharlesRoman,Mon Mar 16 08:53:14 IST 2015,Programming interview questions all day makes Charlie a dull boy.
CharlesRoman,Sun Mar 15 13:44:55 IST 2015,RT @gasty: When @_Mikella has enough Jell-O shots she becomes rainbow dash http://t.co/v7RqTTkg7b
CharlesRoman,Sat Mar 14 02:37:17 IST 2015,"@majornelson The artistic vision of the game overall, art, cinematic, and sound #freecodefriday"
CharlesRoman,Sat Mar 14 02:17:25 IST 2015,"Schedule other phone calls around an interview at 2 PM, 2 PM interview cancels at 1:45 PM. Uggggg... #professionalism"
CharlesRoman,Sat Mar 14 00:55:57 IST 2015,Writing code in a Google Doc makes me want to die. #programmerproblems #interviews
CharlesRoman,Fri Mar 13 23:31:14 IST 2015,"@gibgib Bring him a picture of Charizard next time, if he is going to draw Pokemon in your coffee."
CharlesRoman,Fri Mar 13 02:48:54 IST 2015,Reverse career fair you say? Everyone is using @unity3d? Good thing I started using it 8 years ago.
CharlesRoman,Thu Mar 12 02:27:19 IST 2015,"@ThePlutooo Tell the truth, you didn't know the answer did you?"
CharlesRoman,Thu Mar 12 01:41:49 IST 2015,Being at home has improved my eating and water drinking habits. Maybe I can add a couple years to my life expectancy in these 2 months off.
CharlesRoman,Wed Mar 11 03:42:23 IST 2015,@ThePlutooo @roxaloxa You could try a disguise.
CharlesRoman,Wed Mar 11 02:12:56 IST 2015,@_b0bert_ For sure! I enjoyed my time at EA. I'm excited about new opportunities.
CharlesRoman,Wed Mar 11 00:22:59 IST 2015,"@erkmuss Feels a tad late to the party. But who knows, could be cool."
CharlesRoman,Wed Mar 11 00:17:43 IST 2015,"Went by to pick up my stuff from EA. Having to get a visitor badge was weird, especially when the security guy remembers you."
CharlesRoman,Tue Mar 10 09:39:58 IST 2015,"@erkmuss No, I don't think they showed anything else yet. Although I guess they didn't show anything in that video."
