Matt_NBC4,Mon Feb 29 03:31:37 IST 2016,@QuinnCharney Ugly stuff. Plain and simple
Matt_NBC4,Mon Feb 29 03:30:29 IST 2016,OSU turns it over 11 times in a half and leads Iowa 35-30. Pretty amazing.
Matt_NBC4,Mon Feb 29 03:22:35 IST 2016,@Bucknuts247 true that. But I'm used to that happening haha
Matt_NBC4,Mon Feb 29 03:21:00 IST 2016,"Mitchell doing what OSU needs him to do to pull off this upset. Also Iowa doing what it needs to do, which is turning the ball over a ton"
Matt_NBC4,Mon Feb 29 03:18:37 IST 2016,Did not know Mike Gesell had those kind of hops. Wow.
Matt_NBC4,Mon Feb 29 03:02:42 IST 2016,It's amazing how much better this Buckeye team is when Loving is scoring
Matt_NBC4,Mon Feb 29 01:18:33 IST 2016,"Darron Lee goes 4.49 in his second 40. Unofficial times but no matter what, it's impressive. That'll turn some heads"
Matt_NBC4,Mon Feb 29 01:02:31 IST 2016,And Darron Lee's time was equal to Zeke's and better than Braxton's #LBU  https://t.co/wuD773dCUM
Matt_NBC4,Mon Feb 29 00:59:02 IST 2016,Joshua Perry with a 4.68 40. Pretty good time I'd say.
Matt_NBC4,Mon Feb 29 00:53:39 IST 2016,Darron Lee goes 4.47 in his first 40. That's the fastest time for a LB so far

Matt_NBC4,Sun Feb 28 04:59:27 IST 2016,Jordan Dartis. Second huge 3-pointer. Quiet all game until winning time. That's fine by me #OhioBobcats
Matt_NBC4,Sun Feb 28 04:53:32 IST 2016,Ohio and Buffalo into OT. Setty gets a proper sendoff as he fouls out with 24 pts
Matt_NBC4,Sun Feb 28 04:42:58 IST 2016,Jordan Dartis with the quick release 3 from the corner. And Ohio tied with Buffalo inside a minute.

Matt_NBC4,Fri Feb 26 05:53:22 IST 2016,@JonGriffith27 OL and D-Line. That's all I want. First 4 picks. Get a RB next year or later in the draft. I like Zeke but that line is awful
