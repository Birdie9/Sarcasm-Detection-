WellsTalks,Sun Feb 28 04:47:37 IST 2016,@TommyNotes1 @GlockMagazine On our free day I'll take her to the local gun shop and see what she thinks. She wants to go with 9mm for sure
WellsTalks,Sun Feb 28 03:26:17 IST 2016,"Just want to make one thing clear: I don't carry in hopes to shoot someone. I hope that day never happens, I carry to keep myself safe."
WellsTalks,Sun Feb 28 03:24:13 IST 2016,@TommyNotes1 @GlockMagazine How is the shield to rack? I was planning on getting her that for self defense since she can't rack my glock.

WellsTalks,Thu Feb 25 04:48:00 IST 2016,Open carrying while at cheddar's! Love my 2nd amendment right to protect myself. (Getting my conceal carry asap)
WellsTalks,Wed Feb 24 20:17:16 IST 2016,@coltarstan1911 I hear you on that! I can't wait until I buy it back. I can't say there's a single gun I don't necessarily like.
WellsTalks,Wed Feb 24 20:13:39 IST 2016,"@coltarstan1911 My previous gun I had was a Kimber Stainless II 1911, I LOVED it. The design was perfect, sadly I had to sell it at the time"
