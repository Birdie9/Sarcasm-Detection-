Justinaklein,Mon Feb 22 02:43:06 IST 2016,@monicalsims what does that entail?
Justinaklein,Sun Feb 21 04:29:42 IST 2016,@colezwicker makes sense with some of their late 2nd round picks. I can't see them drafting more than 3 rookies that land on their roster
Justinaklein,Sun Feb 21 04:25:36 IST 2016,"@colezwicker true, but in will be harder to get equal value from them (not impossible) since their option to use the picks are limited."
Justinaklein,Sun Feb 21 04:21:42 IST 2016,@colezwicker they have to trade most of their picks. Have too many which puts them in a bad negotiating position. Teams know they must sell
Justinaklein,Sun Feb 21 04:03:36 IST 2016,Just an FYI. Despite what a lot of people assume and what the media implies voters are allowed to vote for candidates that aren't REP or DEM

Justinaklein,Fri Jan 29 04:48:45 IST 2016,@DanDuangdao @LakersNation Biggest snub of all time!
Justinaklein,Fri Jan 29 02:31:04 IST 2016,@LakersNation Agreed.  He is very underrated even today.  I hope he is the starting center for the lakers next season. The 3rd big FA signed
Justinaklein,Fri Jan 29 01:29:07 IST 2016,@pennystock92 I agree... but what do you base this on?  Besides past issues
Justinaklein,Sat Jan 23 02:45:18 IST 2016,@EricPincus clearly. But he will be considered.

Justinaklein,Sat Jan 09 01:54:31 IST 2016,"@JustinPulitzer lets be honest... they will raise at MAX 2 times this year, my gut says zero and a late year reversal back to ZIRP is likely"
Justinaklein,Fri Jan 08 01:13:43 IST 2016,@JustinPulitzer they are using ineffective policy tools. Productivity is dropping and that is a big problem. Low IR does not solve that
Justinaklein,Thu Jan 07 22:32:04 IST 2016,@JustinPulitzer history says it'll end with a currency collapse and a reset either way. Markets always correct the imbalances in the end.
Justinaklein,Thu Jan 07 11:25:47 IST 2016,@JustinPulitzer so it wouldn't be better to let the bubble collapse and clean out the financial system and end the debt weighing us down?

Justinaklein,Fri Dec 25 07:48:42 IST 2015,@EricPincus so a clear talent upgrade isn't worth $3 mil less cap space? Isn't talent their problem? (I'd argue its more coaching)
Justinaklein,Fri Dec 25 06:27:16 IST 2015,@EricPincus do you think the lakers would be ok with giving up a few mil in cap space next year for Morris and say Goodwin? Lou going out
Justinaklein,Sat Dec 19 01:19:36 IST 2015,@EricPincus are you saying the sh**ter was full?
Justinaklein,Wed Dec 16 06:36:16 IST 2015,@EricPincus @NBAFACTS24 with so many teams with space this summer whiteside is surely getting a max offer. His max is relatively low too

Justinaklein,Fri Dec 11 20:42:48 IST 2015,@EricPincus @gusq21 the lakers are in the driver seat with clarkson. Other teams can only pay him the mid level next 2 seasons. Lakers match

Justinaklein,Tue Dec 08 09:05:29 IST 2015,@EricPincus He doesn't have any.  He does not know what to do coaching wise so he is praying he gets lucky with random lineup combinations
