EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 22:36:06 IST 2015,"MAV is tipping. We keep hearing that. So ""thanks for the tip"" as #sarcastic response to #German Andy Weir sounds strange. Use your #synonyms"
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 22:28:53 IST 2015,Catching myself: I know what an orbital maneuvering system does. But does #generalreader? #Thirdperson #narrator could have helped explain.
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 22:09:14 IST 2015,"""I've got one trick."" Do real #astronauts store up crazy emergency maneuvers they call ""tricks"" or had Andy been watching too much #Firefly?"
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 22:02:50 IST 2015,Martinez has to #mansplain basic MAV attributes to Andy Weir No. 4 to get him to shut up. #Hysteria driven #exposition is a thing I guess.
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 21:56:54 IST 2015,"That was my 1000th #tweet! If I had a dollar for every...time they killed me in this thing, I wouldn't have to work for you, Deke. #blammo"
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 21:53:04 IST 2015,"Watney just as #70s as his much #maligned commander. Obviously a result of #WeirVoice, another example of why #dialog practice necessary."
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 21:34:17 IST 2015,"File this under Unintentional Research: watching #Rocky3, found source of ""kill you to death"" (Watney re RTG danger) #70s #WeirVoice"
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 05:53:07 IST 2015,"Look, Andy Weir didn’t make this a #LadyCharacter. In spite of #hysteria Beck #mansplains things to women & other men like only a dude can."
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 05:50:09 IST 2015,"Beck #hysterical over Watney’s death, wants to let MAV fall over, strand everyone on #Mars bc he has #feelings. Who’s #irrational now?"
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 05:46:02 IST 2015,"Andy Weir No. 4 tries to soothe Lewis into #rational thinking, acceptance of Watney’s death. Silly Beck, ladies are #irrational by nature!"
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 05:41:02 IST 2015,“I don’t feel good about this.” I presume Andy Weir No. 4 is delivering an #homage to #StarWars here. A clumsy homage at best.
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 05:33:28 IST 2015,#Irrational commander working her way through #electromagneticspectrum in her “grasping” search. Suggests #radar to great male disapproval.
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 03:26:07 IST 2015,The representations of Lewis as #incompetent & #irrational continue to build. Not a #strongfemalecharacter—a woman who fails at a man’s job.
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 03:22:01 IST 2015,"If crew suspicious that commander not thinking #rationally, to the point of forgetting obvious facts, then maybe #insubordination in order."
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 03:20:03 IST 2015,"In same breath that he dismisses commander’s “grasping,” Vogel insists crew follow her orders to prep to depart, possibly without Lewis."
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 03:16:05 IST 2015,I cannot in good conscience consider this a #BechdelWin. Too many significant qualifying factors against it. #BechdelFail #LadyWriting
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 03:12:07 IST 2015,"While 2-line exchange technically not DIRECTLY about a man, still indirectly about Watney & declared #inane by all men present. #BechdelTest"
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 03:10:02 IST 2015,Johanssen silent as men declare that Lewis forgets #obvious facts bc she’s “#grasping.” As in losing #rationality in #crisis. #LadyWriting
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 03:08:06 IST 2015,"Using more (& this time #repetitive) character trait #exposition in #dialog, men remind us that Lewis is a #geologist & should know better."
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 03:05:04 IST 2015,Lewis asks Johanssen if #infrared light will help her search through storm. Two men present immediately note that this is a #stupidquestion.
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 03:03:01 IST 2015,"Hey, we finally have a #lady asking a lady to #explain something! It’s not about a man, but I don’t qualify this as a #BechdelTest #win yet."
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 02:57:02 IST 2015,How would drawing lines #magically help her walk straight? Why isn’t Lewis using shiny #homing devices like everyone else? #consistency
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 02:55:05 IST 2015,"I’ve read this paragraph 4 times & I still have no idea why it wasn’t cut. If she can’t see the ground, dragging lines in sand won’t help."
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 02:52:05 IST 2015,"Lewis cannot see the ground. Drags drill bits behind her for 20 meters, then retraces her steps. Discovers she cannot walk straight line."
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 02:48:04 IST 2015,"No idea why or how Lewis gets drill bits “from her back,” which, I should note, shouldn’t be so easy in a #sandstorm that buries her feet."
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 02:42:03 IST 2015,"Re: Lewis, unnecessary, distracting to use “remembering something” to preface character’s actions. This is #understood. Remember, #economy."
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 02:36:03 IST 2015,"Lewis commands crew into MAV while she continues to look for Watney, presumably to return his body. Not overexplained, for once. #MartianWin"
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 01:35:08 IST 2015,"So much #magic & #dumbluck in constant #success of instantly devised #fixes, except major #catastrophes. Would love a few small #failures."
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 01:09:05 IST 2015,Watney #tinkers plenty—or would if he didn’t get everything right on the first try. Lewis’s “take off before it falls!” also not #tinkering.
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 01:05:04 IST 2015,"#Tinkering is a #legitmate thing that people do in #spacetravel #problemsolving, from #CO2 filters on #Apollo13 to #parasol on #Skylab."
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 00:59:02 IST 2015,"MAV can fall ""completely over."" If it's sinking wouldn't it just keep sinking? At this point I’d take #trite #exposition for an explanation."
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 00:57:03 IST 2015,"MAV tilted, tilting more at gusts. Again: is tilting stable? If so is MAV sinking? I don't get the #physics. Somebody #mansplain it to me!"
EditTheMartian,Mon Nov 16 23:53:23 IST 2015,"@PeterYoachim for extra #realism the #LadyCharacters WOULD explain things to men, who would then call them #sexist names behind their backs."
EditTheMartian,Mon Nov 16 23:48:51 IST 2015,"@PeterYoachim I hope you're being sarcastic. If so, astute observation. Reflecting our universe counteracts building #strongfemalecharacters"
EditTheMartian,Mon Nov 16 22:38:08 IST 2015,My first recommendation would be to read @MDoriaRussell for example of how to write multigender #scifi #dialog free of #mansplaining.
EditTheMartian,Mon Nov 16 22:33:06 IST 2015,Read other #scifi authors to see how they handle #exposition in dramatic scenes without relying on #crutch of men explaining stuff to women.
EditTheMartian,Mon Nov 16 22:28:01 IST 2015,"#LadyCharacters ask men to explain stuff they'd likelyknow from training. Hard to do #exposition, but #practice & #research can help."
EditTheMartian,Mon Nov 16 22:24:07 IST 2015,"So far men haven’t done much explaining anything to each other, nor the women to each other, nor women to men. Just men to women #GenderFail"
EditTheMartian,Mon Nov 16 22:21:04 IST 2015,Johanssen reads #code but Beck translates. Lewis needs Beck & Martinez to explain things to her. I get it’s #exposition but it's #gendered.
EditTheMartian,Mon Nov 16 22:17:05 IST 2015,Johanssen & Lewis don’t know how anything works. They do specific trained #labor but ask men to explain tech stuff to them. #LadyWriting
EditTheMartian,Mon Nov 16 21:48:58 IST 2015,Given Johanssen can't see a thing she does remarkable digging thru #telemetry code on her arm. Too bad she doesn't know what any of it means
EditTheMartian,Mon Nov 16 21:45:02 IST 2015,"They're doing complex stuff on ""arm computers"" in zero visibility storm. Hope these are tech #spinoffs bc #firefighters etc. sure could use."
EditTheMartian,Sat Nov 14 20:28:35 IST 2015,"@thebookdesignr no, I'm not in the editing business anymore, at least not professionally. Which is why I'm so snarky here. #unprofessional"
EditTheMartian,Sat Nov 14 05:18:06 IST 2015,"Basically Watney #forgets every #baddecision Lewis makes, lays #comprehensive #blame on #NASA. He definitely has a #crush on her. #barf"
EditTheMartian,Sat Nov 14 05:13:04 IST 2015,"Not only would Watney not have been present to hear NASA’s abort message, but he WAS there for Lewis’s command that they prepare to abort."
EditTheMartian,Sat Nov 14 05:09:05 IST 2015,#Inconsistency: Martinez gets message from #NASA to abort after Watney hit. On p4 Watney says that nobody wanted to abort but NASA made them
EditTheMartian,Sat Nov 14 05:02:04 IST 2015,Martinez returns to MAV to get abort message sent minutes earlier by #NASA. Weird to send important direction somewhere it could be #missed.
EditTheMartian,Sat Nov 14 02:50:01 IST 2015,"Johanssen, of “I can’t see anything” a few sentences ago, is now evaluating #code on her #armcomputer. #magic! https://t.co/X7yhAmItGQ"
EditTheMartian,Sat Nov 14 02:44:04 IST 2015,#TechReveal: Andy Weir No. 4 has an “arm computer.” Which he can see & read perfectly in middle of near #zerovisibility #storm.
EditTheMartian,Sat Nov 14 02:36:06 IST 2015,"Maybe we’ll get a tilt explanation at #exposition #presser next time the #narrative moves to #Earth. Come on, let’s get it right this time."
