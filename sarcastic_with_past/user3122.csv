TinayPunsalang,Tue Jun 02 20:43:00 IST 2015,It's one thing that Fifty Shades is the sexual version of Twilight. But to have Grey just like Midnight Sun! Nothing new there. Ugh.
TinayPunsalang,Tue Jun 02 20:42:06 IST 2015,"GREY is surely just like Midnight Sun. Ugh, totally the same (thr former is just sexual while the latter is fantasy)."

TinayPunsalang,Tue Jun 02 20:34:09 IST 2015,"Mass Comm grads, critique what you see online. Do not just blindly share based on the title. READ. You are not Mass Comm grads for nothing."
TinayPunsalang,Tue Jun 02 20:32:38 IST 2015,Scanning the article and its comments would not take so much of your precious time.
TinayPunsalang,Tue Jun 02 20:30:49 IST 2015,"As Mass Comm grads, you should know better than sharing false news w/o proper disclaimer. Unless they didnt know coz they didnt read it."
TinayPunsalang,Tue Jun 02 20:27:28 IST 2015,So sad how the people who should be helping spread the truth become the victim of fake news.
TinayPunsalang,Tue Jun 02 20:25:09 IST 2015,This only shows that some Mass Comm grads just read the title without bothering to READ or confirming the truth in the article.
TinayPunsalang,Tue Jun 02 20:23:30 IST 2015,"Take note, these Mass Comm grads even expressed their agreement about the fake/satirical articles."
TinayPunsalang,Tue Jun 02 20:21:24 IST 2015,Funny how Mass Communication graduates would share online articles without realizing that the article was just a prank.
