WarofTheWalshy,Wed Feb 24 08:03:08 IST 2016,"@NakBananas @patcondell @MaryamNamazie Same with China, but nope, single out one group as ""bringing rape"". Def not bigoted #sarcasm"
WarofTheWalshy,Wed Feb 24 08:01:25 IST 2016,"@NakBananas @patcondell @MaryamNamazie South Africa has a high rate of rape, but lot of non-Muslims there. Should we call them all rapists?"
WarofTheWalshy,Wed Feb 24 08:00:39 IST 2016,@NakBananas This would be akin to having a Hamas group verify it didn't commit war crimes
WarofTheWalshy,Wed Feb 24 08:00:21 IST 2016,"@NakBananas If people are gathered together by a Friends of Israel initiative to prepare a report, does that sound reliable to you? Come on"
WarofTheWalshy,Wed Feb 24 07:57:36 IST 2016,"@NakBananas Uh, I gave you names earlier. Zeev Schiff, Rabin, Ben-Gurion, all admit to it. Pay attention."
WarofTheWalshy,Wed Feb 24 07:56:21 IST 2016,"@NakBananas Amnesty, HRW, Btselem, PHRI, PCATI, ACRI, Al Haq, FIDH, Gipha many others. There's consensus on what they found."
WarofTheWalshy,Wed Feb 24 07:53:25 IST 2016,@NakBananas It said so in the Times of Israel article.
WarofTheWalshy,Wed Feb 24 07:52:51 IST 2016,"@NakBananas @patcondell @MaryamNamazie Some of whose victims happen to be Muslim, but sure, keep bashing them as rapists."
WarofTheWalshy,Wed Feb 24 07:52:12 IST 2016,@NakBananas Not true. It is not uniquely exclusive to one group.
WarofTheWalshy,Wed Feb 24 07:51:14 IST 2016,"@NakBananas Again, Israeli officials and soldiers admit it. Nothing for them to gain"
WarofTheWalshy,Wed Feb 24 07:50:19 IST 2016,@NakBananas What's the motive for them to come out? What do they have to gain? Nothing. Testimonies that aren't self serving are reliable
WarofTheWalshy,Wed Feb 24 07:49:25 IST 2016,@NakBananas Its claims are consistent with what human rights groups find. To dismiss them in essence is to conjure conspiracy
WarofTheWalshy,Wed Feb 24 07:48:39 IST 2016,"@NakBananas You mean the Friends of Israel initiative? Highly reliable, at odds with human rights reports and UN"
WarofTheWalshy,Wed Feb 24 05:23:51 IST 2016,@NakBananas @patcondell @MaryamNamazie Again can you prove that?
WarofTheWalshy,Wed Feb 24 05:22:42 IST 2016,@NakBananas @patcondell of disproportionate use of force to punish civilians. That is terrorism.
WarofTheWalshy,Wed Feb 24 05:22:22 IST 2016,@NakBananas @patcondell Zeev Schiff admitted they struck civilian populations consciously and that was 80s. Israel has doctrine
WarofTheWalshy,Wed Feb 24 05:20:47 IST 2016,@NakBananas @patcondell Again outright denial of the facts. Breaking the Silence document it. Rabin adopted terrorism against civilians.
WarofTheWalshy,Wed Feb 24 05:17:57 IST 2016,@NakBananas Yeah no. Rape isn't exclusive to one group nor is it unique (nanking remember)
WarofTheWalshy,Wed Feb 24 02:12:37 IST 2016,@DefiantLionUK @patcondell @MaryamNamazie ICTY ruling is definitive on this. Will explore later. Busy now.
WarofTheWalshy,Wed Feb 24 02:06:47 IST 2016,@DefiantLionUK @patcondell @MaryamNamazie Again with the false equivalencies. This is classic tactic for apologists for Serbian aggression.
WarofTheWalshy,Wed Feb 24 02:04:42 IST 2016,"@DefiantLionUK @patcondell @MaryamNamazie You can peddle conspiracies all you want, but most ethnic cleansing/massacres were done by Serbia"
WarofTheWalshy,Wed Feb 24 02:04:10 IST 2016,"@DefiantLionUK @patcondell @MaryamNamazie You can be in denial all you want, but consensus among UN/historians is Serbia was aggressor"
WarofTheWalshy,Wed Feb 24 01:59:16 IST 2016,"@DefiantLionUK @patcondell @MaryamNamazie Milosevic wanted to create a Greater Serbia, so ethnic cleansing followed."
WarofTheWalshy,Wed Feb 24 01:58:04 IST 2016,@DefiantLionUK @patcondell @MaryamNamazie Outright revisionism and false equivalence. Milosevic whipped up ethnic nationalism.
WarofTheWalshy,Wed Feb 24 01:52:09 IST 2016,@DefiantLionUK @patcondell @MaryamNamazie Serbs were aggressors. And stats prove you wrong. More Serb soldiers killed than civilians

WarofTheWalshy,Tue Feb 23 21:26:59 IST 2016,@NakBananas @patcondell Jerome Slater would be good source to consult on this.
WarofTheWalshy,Tue Feb 23 21:26:36 IST 2016,@NakBananas @patcondell Hardly. Israeli officials and soldiers acknowledge privately and publically they commit terrorism of their own.
WarofTheWalshy,Tue Feb 23 21:02:35 IST 2016,@NakBananas @patcondell @MaryamNamazie Yeah that's BS. Every single continent? You pulled that out of thin air. Citations please
WarofTheWalshy,Tue Feb 23 21:00:41 IST 2016,"@NakBananas @patcondell Denial. Point is, it isn't exclusive to one people. To say so is bigotry and selective."
WarofTheWalshy,Tue Feb 23 15:47:21 IST 2016,@NakBananas @patcondell @MaryamNamazie I could go beyond that of course. Lebanon in the 80s if you'll remember.
