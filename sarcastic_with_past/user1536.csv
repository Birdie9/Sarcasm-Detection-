dvpham86,Sun Nov 15 02:31:49 IST 2015,@SuperBroMovies they should've made him look more robotic like ironman
dvpham86,Wed Nov 11 03:11:24 IST 2015,@MikeCairns5 only going to hurt our draft position. Apparently that doesn't matter either since the @browns don't know how to eval talent
dvpham86,Wed Nov 11 03:10:15 IST 2015,@MikeCairns5 At this point in the season being 2-7. I don't think McCown takes us to the playoffs. So even if he wins a couple games. Its..
dvpham86,Wed Nov 11 02:48:52 IST 2015,@MikeCairns5 Do you support this Mike?
dvpham86,Fri Nov 06 21:15:55 IST 2015,@treed1919 @MaryKayCabot release him! lol as a fan it kills me to see the team have 0 discipline.
dvpham86,Fri Nov 06 20:26:46 IST 2015,@DawgsByNature It is when you have an incompetent coach. The team has 0 discipline and that's on Pettine
dvpham86,Fri Nov 06 10:00:24 IST 2015,@DawgsByNature Went pass happy with receivers that can't catch. Its not all on him.
dvpham86,Fri Nov 06 02:49:39 IST 2015,@ESPNStatsInfo so you're saying there's a chance
dvpham86,Thu Nov 05 23:11:16 IST 2015,@SportsCenter @AdamSchefter tell me the Browns are next.
dvpham86,Thu Nov 05 23:05:14 IST 2015,@MikeCairns5 he's being set up for failure. Other young QBs have a chance to succeed. Browns haven't done much to help Manziel #firepettine

dvpham86,Wed Nov 04 20:16:34 IST 2015,@RuiterWrongFAN either he's delusional or the dumbest GM ever
dvpham86,Wed Nov 04 03:16:15 IST 2015,@TheKovach fine. Just thought it would be a good question.
dvpham86,Wed Nov 04 03:14:06 IST 2015,@TheKovach Ask him why he didn't want Brandon Marshall or Chris Johnson
dvpham86,Wed Nov 04 03:11:57 IST 2015,@RuiterWrongFAN ask him why he didn't want chris johnson or brandon marshall
dvpham86,Wed Nov 04 03:09:54 IST 2015,@RuiterWrongFAN So he saying he drafted a bunch of guys that can't earn playing time. He should just admit he sucks as a GM. #WTF
dvpham86,Wed Nov 04 03:08:07 IST 2015,@TheKennyRoda How has he made this team better? He's admitting that his draft picks haven't earned playing time. HE PICKED THEM!

dvpham86,Tue Nov 03 05:34:53 IST 2015,@KeithBritton86 @923TheFan @@BullandFox don't know if anyone brought up this point. Maybe McCown is fighting for himself. He wants to start
dvpham86,Tue Nov 03 00:09:58 IST 2015,@RuiterWrongFAN I'd say he's had more of a chance than Chud did.
