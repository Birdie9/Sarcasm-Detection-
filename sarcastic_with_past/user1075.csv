vegasbrawler,Sun Jan 03 04:33:47 IST 2016,At the movies. My kid is eating popcorn and drinking soda. I'm eating carrots and drinking minimal sugar kombucha.
vegasbrawler,Sun Jan 03 03:57:04 IST 2016,@badge_madge @PukingBuffalo @TortillaNazi Maybe. That's why I needed the weekend to buffer before the workweek. You'll be fine!
