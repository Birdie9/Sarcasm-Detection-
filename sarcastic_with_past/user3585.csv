dabear01,Fri Apr 24 19:24:28 IST 2015,"@osstf heard your radio ad. You do have a choice. You chose to go on strike. Only thing this is hurting, is the students."
dabear01,Fri Apr 24 18:58:35 IST 2015,@OMSoshawa exactly!
dabear01,Fri Apr 24 17:58:14 IST 2015,@OMSoshawa I know it is. We go through the same thing every year here!
dabear01,Fri Apr 24 17:57:14 IST 2015,"Odds are that if 3 cars were able to stop at the red light before you, you could have as well. Wasnt even close! #idiots #commuterproblems"
dabear01,Fri Apr 24 17:55:18 IST 2015,You've known for the last 5km that your lane was ending. Don't look so shocked when I won't let you in because you waited to the last second
dabear01,Fri Apr 24 17:52:05 IST 2015,"I think as an old person, one of the last things you should be doing is #jaywalking. You don't move too quick at the best of times!"
dabear01,Fri Apr 24 17:50:28 IST 2015,So yesterday I had to scrape ice off my car. Today it was snow I had to brush off! #ohcanada
dabear01,Thu Apr 23 19:46:03 IST 2015,"@penguins it was also quickly followed by ""I hate you New York Rangers!"" #didntlearnthatfromme"
dabear01,Thu Apr 23 19:44:06 IST 2015,"Told Jackson the @penguins were playing tomorrow night. His response: ""Woo I love you Pittsburgh!"". The kid is almost 6! #NHLPlayoffs"
dabear01,Thu Apr 23 18:32:20 IST 2015,You know you're doing road work. How hard is it to put out a sign saying one lane will be closed? #construction #commuterproblems
dabear01,Wed Apr 22 18:05:48 IST 2015,@canhowie @Bistro_67 @durhamcollege agreed! Have yet to have a bad meal or service there
dabear01,Wed Apr 22 18:04:58 IST 2015,"@osstf I don't care what you guys do with your time. But when you affect my commute time, I lose all sympathy for you and your cause."
dabear01,Sun Apr 19 23:02:10 IST 2015,"A bit windy, but otherwise a good day for a 10K run with @OBaranowsky #TYS10K"
dabear01,Fri Apr 17 23:11:42 IST 2015,"Whenever I don't want to share my snack with my #kids, I tell them it has #alcohol in it."
dabear01,Thu Apr 16 18:03:05 IST 2015,Only in #Canada can you have 2 straight 20 plus degree days and still have #snow on the ground! #coldwinter #springhassprung
dabear01,Thu Apr 16 18:01:59 IST 2015,Good job #assclowns ! Two cars passed a bus who had it's stop sign out and signals flashing! #idiots
dabear01,Thu Apr 16 18:01:14 IST 2015,That was awesome!  Just watched a dump truck pull a #philadelphialeftturn

dabear01,Wed Apr 15 20:27:55 IST 2015,Almost hit a #jaywalker last night. She ran across the road as I was going through the middle of the intersection. #SurvivalOfTheFittest
dabear01,Wed Apr 15 20:25:46 IST 2015,"A good way to get yourself killed: #jaywalking with your head down texting and your headphones in, and darting out from between 2 SUV's!"

dabear01,Thu Apr 02 19:07:15 IST 2015,Saw a man wearing a suit of aluminum foil. How else do you explain the high shine properties of that thing?

dabear01,Thu Apr 02 18:17:52 IST 2015,Saw a woman wearing a poncho this morning. Only thing missing from her ensemble was the #urbansombraro! #seinfeldreference
dabear01,Wed Apr 01 01:12:16 IST 2015,I feel quite foolish when trying to open a door only to find it's locked! Why do businesses have double doors if they keep one side locked?
dabear01,Tue Mar 31 18:49:52 IST 2015,"Perhaps you wouldn't have almost run me over if you had bothered to scrape off your windows. That, and actually coming to a stop!"
dabear01,Tue Mar 31 18:46:21 IST 2015,"@mvencel exactly! Much like our father's did to us, and theirs did to them. #carryonthetradition"

dabear01,Mon Mar 30 00:36:57 IST 2015,"Great way to spend a lazy Sunday: a bowl of #chipnuts, #coldbeer and the #NCAATournament"
dabear01,Mon Mar 30 00:20:25 IST 2015,How to tell spring has sprung in Canada! http://t.co/mcO6SVOgFz

dabear01,Tue Mar 24 02:05:37 IST 2015,Your volume for your phone may be a bit on the loud side if: I can hear it ringing in your car from 40' away!
dabear01,Sat Mar 21 06:36:42 IST 2015,@JeremyClarkson hope it's a favourable outcome for you @MrJamesMay and @RichardHammond. Missing #topgear on this side of the pond!
dabear01,Sat Mar 21 06:19:04 IST 2015,It's not looking good for #RobertMorris. Would like to see the upset over #Duke. For no other reason than I really don't like them! #ncaa
dabear01,Sat Mar 21 00:41:47 IST 2015,It's a lot easier to start the day when you know it will end with #beer! #Friday
dabear01,Fri Mar 20 19:16:54 IST 2015,That man has his priorities straight: ice skates buckled up in the front seat; wife in the back with the rest of his hockey gear!
dabear01,Fri Mar 20 01:33:47 IST 2015,@canhowie you own a small pony though. Completely different than a rodent sized thing
dabear01,Fri Mar 20 01:21:48 IST 2015,If it fits in your purse it's a rodent not a dog!
dabear01,Fri Mar 20 01:21:19 IST 2015,"It's a bank, NOT a pet store. Leave your dog in the car. If you don't want to, leave it at home."
