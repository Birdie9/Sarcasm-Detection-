epberg,Fri May 29 19:49:05 IST 2015,@BigMoStriker @Reddy @WSJecon It's always good to ask for a meaningful conclusion from an article like this. We need fiscal stimulus. Period
epberg,Fri May 29 18:54:30 IST 2015,@CarmineZozzora @TheJuanWilliams @mkhammer @FoxNews Monetary easing doesn't make people confident about their jobs. Need fiscal stimulus.

epberg,Fri May 29 18:39:29 IST 2015,"@Reddy @WSJecon The question I have is, does this have any meaning?"
epberg,Fri May 29 17:54:53 IST 2015,@paradiselost_17 @GrnEyedMandy Conservs have learned from Dems that buying votes works. They just aren't as good at it. For what? Detroit.
epberg,Fri May 29 08:43:39 IST 2015,@paradiselost_17 @GrnEyedMandy I think you mean: they're both people. That would be true. Obama has created more debt than thought possible.
epberg,Fri May 29 08:41:01 IST 2015,"@revbrianleut You most likely don't have sufficient education either. The more one knows, the less religion is possible."
epberg,Fri May 29 08:36:35 IST 2015,@Conservative_VW When will we all stop listening to him?
epberg,Fri May 29 08:35:54 IST 2015,"@GrnEyedMandy @paradiselost_17 Well, it looks like you'll have to accept leaders who will continue to spend like drunken sailors."

epberg,Fri May 29 03:23:56 IST 2015,@OpenlySecular It's called the local electrical utility. Nothing else.
epberg,Fri May 29 03:08:00 IST 2015,@dianabill Such statements are why religion generally is losing followers. Who wants to associate with such people?
epberg,Fri May 29 00:00:19 IST 2015,@KatiePavlich @CarmineZozzora The truth hurts. We are losing our country. Just like our government.
epberg,Thu May 28 23:45:35 IST 2015,"@FoxBusiness @RandPaul With the international arms-trade so prominent, our accidentally giving arms to ISIS was, and is, irrelevant. STUPID!"
epberg,Thu May 28 22:56:53 IST 2015,@Conservative_VW The most difficult thing about maintaining a long marriage relationship is that people change. And in different directions.
epberg,Thu May 28 08:22:42 IST 2015,@WSJ @RachelFeintzeig I think leveling negotiating skills among new hires is just peachy. How long will that last on the job? For women too?
epberg,Thu May 28 08:17:41 IST 2015,@DanPatrickTX @TexasGOP And even that only works out half the time!
epberg,Thu May 28 07:58:54 IST 2015,@BumpinGemz @dianabill  When was the last time a human made it through a Minnesota winter without heat? Case closed.
epberg,Thu May 28 07:56:34 IST 2015,@grindingdude And we wonder why so many believe whatever they are told by the MSM.
epberg,Thu May 28 04:58:12 IST 2015,@SMolloyDVM @LeahR77 Fallen from what? From God's plan?
epberg,Thu May 28 04:56:34 IST 2015,@PHLane I lived in DFWTexas for 6 years and large tomatoes wouldn't set because of the heat. Romas and cherries were good. MN all great!
epberg,Thu May 28 04:51:20 IST 2015,@SMolloyDVM @LeahR77 It's random nature. Look at the history. There is no plan. Obvious as can be.
epberg,Thu May 28 04:43:50 IST 2015,"@PHLane They may be tasty, but I don't see how they could be better than Minnesota tomatoes. We just have to wait until late July!"

epberg,Thu May 28 04:31:21 IST 2015,@WhatIsArtFilm @SJ_Murray And persistence. And patience.

epberg,Thu May 28 01:04:47 IST 2015,@kevinolearytv I have a cousin who lives in FL. He says the business of FL is taking money from old people.
epberg,Thu May 28 01:02:46 IST 2015,@RawStory @LeahNTorres I think this would be a good idea if the state agreed to fund raising the child to 18 yo.
epberg,Thu May 28 01:01:10 IST 2015,@TechCrunch @alexia I wish there were more interesting things to read about. This issue is trivial compared to what is really important.
epberg,Thu May 28 00:26:08 IST 2015,@CoolCzech1 @ChristieC733 @MaydnUSA I think this would make a good plot line. Maybe Netflix?

epberg,Wed May 27 20:48:25 IST 2015,@DavidLimbaugh It's always better to base your opinions on established facts. Anything else is just one person's unsubstantiated opinion.
epberg,Wed May 27 20:46:23 IST 2015,@BAMAPERRY @weaselzippers The origin of ISIS is the Muslim Brotherhood. They laid the groundwork for male Muslim dissatisfaction.

epberg,Wed May 27 04:43:07 IST 2015,@RelUnrelated @MrOzAtheist The scary thing is that there are people who believe him. Believers don't question.
