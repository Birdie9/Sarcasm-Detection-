Greg_Teschke,Thu Nov 19 07:44:36 IST 2015,@molly_knight I commend you for saying he may never be a finalist again. I agree. Everyone seems to think he is a sure ace going forward.

Greg_Teschke,Tue Nov 17 00:11:18 IST 2015,@BPspeak @MattSpiegel670 agree. If Gase is the next Sean Payton and we let him go to hold Fox.....ugh
Greg_Teschke,Tue Nov 17 00:00:24 IST 2015,@BPspeak @MattSpiegel670 without Gase I don't want Cutler at 17mil.
Greg_Teschke,Mon Nov 16 10:16:52 IST 2015,@mikewilkening why are these two teams afraid of screen passes?
Greg_Teschke,Mon Nov 16 08:28:56 IST 2015,Why in the hell did that review take so long? NFL product gets worse by the week. #NFL #SEAvsARI
Greg_Teschke,Mon Nov 16 02:37:52 IST 2015,@WaddleandSilvy nothing to talk about. Love Forte but it's a bad business decision to extend him.
Greg_Teschke,Mon Nov 16 02:30:01 IST 2015,"@MattSpiegel670 @AdamHoge and Gase is as good as gone so back to the drawing board, aka crayons next year #Bears"

Greg_Teschke,Mon Nov 16 01:10:50 IST 2015,@Eric_Edholm @ChrisBurke_SI if Bears are going to keep Cutler they better launch Fox and keep Gase.

Greg_Teschke,Sat Nov 14 08:24:01 IST 2015,@LondonMike83 @NicoleArbour well if you are against prayer but in favor on uniting via hashtags I will remove myself from the conversation
Greg_Teschke,Sat Nov 14 08:22:15 IST 2015,"But hey, they addressed the fact that they cared for a bit, so now they can move past it"
Greg_Teschke,Sat Nov 14 08:21:11 IST 2015,Always interesting to see people line up with social media prayers and hashtags when tragedy strikes. Then tomorrow they will move on.
Greg_Teschke,Sat Nov 14 08:18:14 IST 2015,@LondonMike83 @NicoleArbour you are delusional if you think hashtags and social media prayer tosses are impactful.
Greg_Teschke,Sat Nov 14 08:13:42 IST 2015,@NicoleArbour hashtags don't impact anything.
Greg_Teschke,Sat Nov 14 08:04:54 IST 2015,"@NicoleArbour how exactly do we ""be strong for them""? Sounds good but it's complete nonsensical Twitter speak."

Greg_Teschke,Tue Nov 10 20:53:50 IST 2015,@wsoxbearshawks @RapSheet feel free to believe that 10 years in Cutler has finally changed
Greg_Teschke,Tue Nov 10 19:11:02 IST 2015,@RapSheet pick 6 and a fumble inside the 40. Same stuff he has always done. He played well at end to win but he's still same guy. Average QB
Greg_Teschke,Mon Nov 09 10:37:28 IST 2015,@RoFloESPN no single player looks worse in his uniform than Bradford. Put on a wristband or something and get some pads that fit.
