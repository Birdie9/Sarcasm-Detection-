TBLFANnFL,Mon Jan 04 02:05:03 IST 2016,@KingBillyV @wjgreen_  Another RW asshole that only sees what they want. These morons have threatened violence if police try remove them.

TBLFANnFL,Thu Dec 31 21:28:13 IST 2015,@arielgonzo97 @rtcolicci2 Exactly. I am not complaining about the CAP mind you. I think it levels the playing field for small market teams.
TBLFANnFL,Thu Dec 31 19:50:52 IST 2015,@arielgonzo97 @rtcolicci2 I don't think the team treats them badly.Vinny was a victim of the CAP and Marty was a crybaby asshole in the end.
TBLFANnFL,Thu Dec 31 09:44:22 IST 2015,Food night #tblightning fans. Everyone have a safe New Year's Eve. Maybe the New Year will bring our team better luck.
TBLFANnFL,Thu Dec 31 09:41:34 IST 2015,@arielgonzo97 @rtcolicci2 Went through this when Stammer was an RFA and his contract was up. Only thing then was him being an RFA.

TBLFANnFL,Thu Dec 31 09:36:47 IST 2015,"@arielgonzo97 @rtcolicci2 If SY can't sign him he needs to get a replacement for Stamkos. Not more draft picks,a guy that can step in now."
TBLFANnFL,Thu Dec 31 09:34:39 IST 2015,@ojesseca23 @ChicknParmMafia They rented St Louis. Cally is still playing. Didn't get Cally to be a goal scorer. He is a great two way guy.
TBLFANnFL,Thu Dec 31 09:33:15 IST 2015,@arielgonzo97 @rtcolicci2 I hate to say it but with no deal done you have to think they can't work one out. Needs to be resolved b4 trade DL
TBLFANnFL,Thu Dec 31 09:31:03 IST 2015,@BoltsGameDay This team has no reason to tank. Not like we are hurting for talent. Yeah has so much talent they can't get them in games.
TBLFANnFL,Thu Dec 31 09:27:41 IST 2015,@arielgonzo97 @rtcolicci2 Not me.I knew it would be a huge deal. I have seen it before. Teams tend to let these things get under their skin.
TBLFANnFL,Thu Dec 31 09:25:20 IST 2015,@arielgonzo97 Absolutely. Playing like they don't really care. Do they think teams are going to give up because it the Bolts???
TBLFANnFL,Thu Dec 31 09:22:49 IST 2015,@rtcolicci2 I don't care what anyone says. Some of this has to be the  Stamkos contract thing hanging over the team.
TBLFANnFL,Thu Dec 31 09:19:54 IST 2015,@arielgonzo97 The problem is they play with ZERO passion and ZERO urgency. It's hard to believe this is the same team that made the Finals.
