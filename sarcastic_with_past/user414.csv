Dadov3,Thu Mar 24 07:07:15 IST 2016,@aaronbruski but he's good on paper and he came from the Spurs #sarcastic
Dadov3,Wed Mar 23 09:40:39 IST 2016,@nyc_sportz @basketballtalk yea I feel sorry for Knick fans
Dadov3,Wed Mar 23 05:33:00 IST 2016,@Cowbell_Kingdom realistic shooting guards that want to come to Sacramento not too many
Dadov3,Wed Mar 23 05:29:34 IST 2016,"@nyc_sportz @basketballtalk that would be nice, give the smaller markets a chance"
Dadov3,Tue Mar 22 01:43:59 IST 2016,"@roughdauber @James_Ham I just realized I asked about Rondo, I meant McLemore.  Oops"
Dadov3,Tue Mar 22 01:32:06 IST 2016,@roughdauber @James_Ham isn't just a wrist thing?  Is it broken? Fractured?
Dadov3,Tue Mar 22 01:30:51 IST 2016,"@sactownroyalty non issue, forward people"
Dadov3,Tue Mar 22 01:26:19 IST 2016,@basketballtalk Knicks and Lakers set to pursue every single  good free agent
Dadov3,Tue Mar 22 01:24:27 IST 2016,"@James_Ham man, what is wrong with Rondo?"
Dadov3,Sun Mar 20 22:32:38 IST 2016,"@FisolaNYDN @James_Ham yes, but do the Knicks what him?  didn't Woj mention on radio nobody wants Rondo?"
Dadov3,Sun Mar 20 09:41:02 IST 2016,"@SactoKingsFan @Vivek I'm thinking if Rondo goes, Rudy follows suit or vice versa.  Then I have no idea what Cuz does"
Dadov3,Sun Mar 20 09:38:36 IST 2016,"@ailene_voisin starts with their solid ownership, front office and a little luck....see 1997 #1 overall draft pick"
Dadov3,Sun Mar 20 09:33:52 IST 2016,"@CarmichaelDave if other teams humans had as many distractions as Kings teams humans, those teams would be in a world of hurt too"
Dadov3,Sun Mar 20 09:31:12 IST 2016,"@ailene_voisin I think Kings would be ""A ok"" if they had owners and front office comparable to Spurs."
Dadov3,Sat Mar 19 22:22:50 IST 2016,"@teamziller franchise is dysfunctional starting from the top. Once ownership is stable, front office, coaching is positively taken care of"
Dadov3,Sat Mar 19 09:58:54 IST 2016,@SactoKingsFan hopefully a whole lot different#fresh start
Dadov3,Fri Mar 18 20:48:56 IST 2016,"@Cowbell_Kingdom unless kings start over, please, no more young players"
Dadov3,Fri Mar 18 08:38:26 IST 2016,@aaronbruski @HeyitsAman it changes once ownership &front office are on same page to do something different.  Don't see that happening.
Dadov3,Fri Mar 18 07:04:58 IST 2016,"@polonius916 @aaronbruski hoping to see a functional product, but unless Vivek leaves his ego at the door#disfunctionalbballops"
Dadov3,Fri Mar 18 06:23:06 IST 2016,"@GrantNapearshow @discgman ok, but he needs some serious help"
Dadov3,Fri Mar 18 06:21:59 IST 2016,"@aaronbruski so next year we'll be saying, ""wait till next year"" and the season after that, & season after that and so on"
Dadov3,Wed Mar 16 08:51:18 IST 2016,"@James_Ham if those 2 players were in the East, yes"
Dadov3,Mon Mar 14 23:54:00 IST 2016,@Squid7251G @SacramentoKings @MikeAndMike not even close.  #2022playoffs
Dadov3,Mon Mar 14 04:57:41 IST 2016,"@kayte_c but we're only ""X"" amount of games from the 8th seed"
Dadov3,Mon Mar 14 04:54:00 IST 2016,@samesfandiari @aaronbruski depends what Cuz wants#circus isintown
Dadov3,Sun Mar 13 05:40:12 IST 2016,@SeanCunningham that 20-23 record was very misleading
Dadov3,Sun Mar 13 04:53:05 IST 2016,"@CarmichaelDave organization is in desperate need of consistency.  Have to keep coach and Cuz 1 more season, see where it takes them"
Dadov3,Thu Mar 10 13:48:48 IST 2016,@CarmichaelDave Worse?? Didn't Vlade mortgage Kings future ?
Dadov3,Thu Mar 10 13:23:49 IST 2016,"@ZachLowe_NBA Cuz single handedly lost the game.  Great individual stats, took a step back with lack of positive  attitude, poise/leadership"
Dadov3,Mon Mar 07 06:30:40 IST 2016,"@MarkG_Medina ""Zero""?  Really? Not literally I guess."
Dadov3,Sun Mar 06 07:46:30 IST 2016,"@mr_jasonjones live him, but I don't think that's a winning recipe"
Dadov3,Fri Mar 04 07:59:43 IST 2016,@kingraiders412 @aaronbruski I think you're on to something there
Dadov3,Fri Mar 04 00:34:34 IST 2016,"@PRS209 @aaronbruski wo there cowboy, on this team debatable, but on most considerable  playoff teams, not really"
Dadov3,Fri Mar 04 00:32:18 IST 2016,"@kingraiders412 @aaronbruski I feel you, it's only a start.  BTW, I watch my fair share"
Dadov3,Thu Mar 03 11:33:31 IST 2016,"@aaronbruski not sure a Coach is going to change culture of this team, a well rounded starting 2 and 4 will.  Stein is not a starter yet."
Dadov3,Wed Mar 02 11:22:25 IST 2016,@CarmichaelDave @MM6o2 2/10??
Dadov3,Tue Mar 01 22:50:04 IST 2016,"@CarmichaelDave @MM6o2 well gosh, that makes me feel so much better. #trade him"
Dadov3,Tue Mar 01 22:49:12 IST 2016,@CarmichaelDave @Aykis16 could have said that when they went 12-20 and lost to Philly and Troy Daniels.
Dadov3,Mon Feb 29 01:39:03 IST 2016,"@CarmichaelDave geeeee, let me think."
Dadov3,Wed Feb 24 22:45:01 IST 2016,"@crichards8 @mr_jasonjones as much as it takes, these owners are billionaires"
Dadov3,Wed Feb 24 22:44:35 IST 2016,"@mr_jasonjones @crichards8 no I don't think they will, but I hope"
Dadov3,Wed Feb 24 10:02:57 IST 2016,"@CarmichaelDave yep and he already is, now lets get a good GM, the right coach with the right players and vice versa"
Dadov3,Wed Feb 24 09:58:40 IST 2016,"@BlakeEllington wow, about 10' separation there.  That picture explains all the losses I guess"
Dadov3,Wed Feb 24 09:56:59 IST 2016,@CarmichaelDave I believe Kings were 12-18 or close to that and Philly was coming up
Dadov3,Wed Feb 24 09:53:34 IST 2016,"@CarmichaelDave I think that's before they lost to Philly at home, not positive though"
Dadov3,Wed Feb 24 09:52:15 IST 2016,"@CarmichaelDave come on Dave, even Napier mentioned on radio he didn't think Kings could recover if they went 12-20."
Dadov3,Wed Feb 24 09:50:33 IST 2016,@aaronbruski all Kings teams since 2006
Dadov3,Wed Feb 24 09:48:45 IST 2016,"@gwiss new GM, new coach, new and better players for Cuz and we'll be alright"
Dadov3,Wed Feb 24 09:47:15 IST 2016,"@MichaelVPina well, according to the NBA ref, it is, probably called an offensive foul in college."
Dadov3,Wed Feb 24 09:37:54 IST 2016,"@MichaelVPina I actually disagree, those acting shooting attempts are called often"
