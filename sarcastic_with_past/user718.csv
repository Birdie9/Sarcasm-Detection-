cdhthegreat,Thu Feb 11 09:49:07 IST 2016,@Disciple2123 @houstonfan00 or we could run an offense that can use players that aren't 40% 3 point shooters
cdhthegreat,Thu Feb 11 09:46:31 IST 2016,@Disciple2123 @houstonfan00 how many 4's are good at that?
cdhthegreat,Thu Feb 11 09:46:18 IST 2016,@Disciple2123 @houstonfan00 if you're not harden or Howard all you're supposed to do is jack standstill 3's
cdhthegreat,Thu Feb 11 09:43:56 IST 2016,@Disciple2123 @houstonfan00 has anyone stopped to think that maybe the offense minimizes the power forward spot?
cdhthegreat,Thu Feb 11 09:22:53 IST 2016,@AstroRocket @ComplexMag love the show (and Hayley Atwell is underratedly fine).  Hope it gets renewed.

cdhthegreat,Thu Feb 11 05:21:22 IST 2016,@RedNinetyFour @curlybojangles I don't think morey will be fired but a GM cannot be evaluated solely on expectations.  Results matter
