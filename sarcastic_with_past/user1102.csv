RichQonQ,Tue Jan 05 02:41:35 IST 2016,"@JFMcMullen worse thing now u wonder new HC, new offensive system again for Eli! Not at this stage of career. tom goes, Reese had to go"
RichQonQ,Tue Jan 05 02:39:24 IST 2016,@JFMcMullen that roster is void of talent no pass rush exposed secondary nothing was addressed in offseason & draft
RichQonQ,Tue Jan 05 02:38:52 IST 2016,"@JFMcMullen taking more heat, that's an understatement. Tom was fall guy, Reese draft history has been bad. Yeah some hits..but"
RichQonQ,Tue Jan 05 02:35:20 IST 2016,"@JFMcMullen Giants don't operate in that fashion, more shocked Reese is safe after horrible drafts"
RichQonQ,Tue Jan 05 02:32:14 IST 2016,@JFMcMullen I know I was being sarcastic.
RichQonQ,Tue Jan 05 02:31:47 IST 2016,#chipkelly is not cut out to handle ny market so I will hold off on bridge. He is not definition of #giants HC or what they look for
