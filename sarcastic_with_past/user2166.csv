Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:54:29 IST 2016,I can‚Äôt wait for the epic love poem tweets like after Gorges was dealt. #sarcasm
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:54:07 IST 2016,I‚Äôm really not broken up about Weise going. I like him but nowhere near to the extent that so many others do‚Ä¶ wow some of these laments.
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:52:40 IST 2016,@alour You can have the 20 character guys who can‚Äôt score and never see a Cup. I‚Äôd rather see a Cup.
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:51:09 IST 2016,@pfournier33 LOL Touch√©.
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:50:54 IST 2016,@pfournier33 Yeah that‚Äôs how I read it too. I really hate the word character to describe a player. That‚Äôs how bad this has gotten for me.
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:49:41 IST 2016,I‚Äôd rather have an asshole who can score 30 goals than another frigging character guy who can‚Äôt score 10.
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:48:57 IST 2016,Whenever someone lauds a player as a great character guy my first thought is ‚ÄúSo he can‚Äôt score goals but MT will love him.‚Äù #conditioning
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:47:28 IST 2016,@HankBart91 I still think 18 will be bad but whatever. It‚Äôs pie in the sky to me because it‚Äôs so far away.
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:46:17 IST 2016,@alour I have no faith left and I‚Äôve seen too many rumour tweets about dealing him.
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:46:00 IST 2016,@Jeffery_James He‚Äôs so fun to watch‚Ä¶ or at least he was when I was in SJ.
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:45:27 IST 2016,@HankBart91 but 2018? Really? And Chicago always contends so it‚Äôll be a low round 2nd.
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:45:04 IST 2016,@HankBart91 I don‚Äôt know that I was expecting anything in particular. I‚Äôm more interested in the draft pick than Danault who the fuck ever.
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:44:07 IST 2016,Who scarfs more hotdogs in the press box? McCarron or Ellis? Or are they trade bait? I‚Äôm terrified they‚Äôll deal McCarron. Trust is gone.
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:43:07 IST 2016,@ChrisArnold33 I hate that Carey covers up for a shit coach. Love Carey but there‚Äôs a severe downside attached for me because he‚Äôs so great.
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:42:10 IST 2016,@pfournier33 I don‚Äôt like 99% of TV shows. Will stick to my books thanks.
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:41:34 IST 2016,@ChrisArnold33 Ah gotcha thanks.
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:41:22 IST 2016,@pfournier33 Seriously won‚Äôt be watching if Therrien is still coaching next season. I‚Äôm done with this coach.
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:40:54 IST 2016,@ChrisArnold33 Thanks but so what? Seriously? We have plenty of character apparently. It‚Äôs not a selling point for me anymore.
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:40:08 IST 2016,@KRISER1222 It usually is. @BigRedHabs
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:39:52 IST 2016,Not going to google or GAF about Danault. Another bottom 6 Therrien style guy. Big whoop.
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:39:10 IST 2016,@pfournier33 Yes I know. But trading for Therrien type players makes me think that he‚Äôs not going anywhere anytime soon. @stevofarnham
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:38:31 IST 2016,@pfournier33 Danault seems like he‚Äôs cast from the same mould. He‚Äôll fit right in. Therrien will be fine with it I‚Äôm sure.
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:37:41 IST 2016,@stevofarnham Seems we‚Äôre not going to get any offence ever. We‚Äôre just going to get character defenders & Therrien riding Carey forever.
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:36:03 IST 2016,It feels like Bergevin is going to back Therrien until the end of time. It really does. ‚ÄúNo offence! All defence!‚Äù I‚Äôm so discouraged.
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:35:28 IST 2016,Now we just need to deal our two top line wingers and we can have 12 bottom 6 forwards who can all defend and whom Therrien will adore.

Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:30:30 IST 2016,As long as the important points are covered then. https://t.co/wdPW0Rn8TP
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:28:06 IST 2016,*sigh* Weise AND Fleischmann for another 4th liner and a low 2nd round pick? I‚Äôm sure Danault is a character guy though.

Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 05:26:28 IST 2016,"@stevofarnham Ah. See I do because I‚Äôm not one to drink a lot of milk. Mostly just have it for tea, sometimes cereal. Not often."
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 05:26:06 IST 2016,@stefmeloche Exactly. But I also think it‚Äôs kind of a cheat and I don‚Äôt like that at all.
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 05:24:26 IST 2016,@stevofarnham I buy from local dairy farmers and they have good milk! Usually lasts a few days past expiry. LOL
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 05:23:49 IST 2016,Oooooh a Price update. Our season is saved! MT is safe! #HellNo #AreYouSerious
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 05:22:51 IST 2016,@stevofarnham On the rumour tweet things I agree but you gotta lay off the milk. Go for rotten eggs or something instead.
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 05:22:26 IST 2016,@stefmeloche Well I think it‚Äôs another work around and I don‚Äôt like cheating cheaters who cheat! IT favours the smarter GMs! üòú
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 05:21:14 IST 2016,"@stevofarnham Sometimes, depending on the fridge and the quality of the milk, milk can last a day or two past expiry. Harsh."
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 05:19:34 IST 2016,"I want the CBA changed so there are no salary retentions for trades. If he‚Äôs got an insane cap hit, teams must pay the sticker price."
