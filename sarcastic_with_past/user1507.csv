toshevon,Thu Oct 15 22:03:11 IST 2015,@NERCNG @SamAmadi It has been over a month and we still don't have power all because we are being expcted to buy transformer for PHED.
toshevon,Thu Oct 15 21:58:55 IST 2015,@NERCNG @SamAmadi Still patiently waiting for your response to who is supposed to be regulating Discos transformer related activities.

toshevon,Tue Oct 06 15:43:26 IST 2015,@NERCNG @SamAmadi ...to discuss with the DISCO. Which one is it exactly: should we or should we not buy transformers by ourselves?
toshevon,Tue Oct 06 15:42:39 IST 2015,"@NERCNG @SamAmadi Recall in 2012, NERC asked Yenagoan's to stop transformer purchase (http://t.co/JMqeGyqKqJ), now we are being asked..."
toshevon,Tue Oct 06 15:38:53 IST 2015,"@NERCNG @SamAmadi OK. Please, refer me to the body in charge of regulating the DISCO's activities with regards to issuance of transformers."
toshevon,Tue Oct 06 15:37:37 IST 2015,@NERCNG @SamAmadi Meaning you don't regulate the DISCO's activities when it concerns services being rendered to consumers?
toshevon,Tue Oct 06 15:32:48 IST 2015,@NERCNG @SamAmadi NERCNG will only wait till it becomes an arbitration issue before they step in. That's a very good one one your part.
toshevon,Tue Oct 06 15:31:19 IST 2015,"@NERCNG @SamAmadi Technically speaking,NERCNG does't have a policy framework for such a situation. It's a matter of Consumer-DISCO agreement"
toshevon,Tue Oct 06 15:08:14 IST 2015,"@NERCNG ..of the consumer since after purchase, the transformer becomes the property of the DISCO. How does the consumer enforce his rights?"
toshevon,Tue Oct 06 15:07:18 IST 2015,@NERCNG The question still remains: What's the modality involved in such a situation. Is there any policy in place to protect the interest..
toshevon,Tue Oct 06 13:33:48 IST 2015,@NERCNG @SamAmadi Still same: No light as they are still saying they don't have any transformer on ground expect we choose to pay for one.
toshevon,Tue Oct 06 12:45:14 IST 2015,@JumiaNGHelp What baffles me is that the washing machine is still available for purchase http://t.co/olDLYyiaiz; so why was it cancelled?
toshevon,Mon Oct 05 23:02:54 IST 2015,@JumiaNGHelp I just check now and only the TV was dispatched and the washing machine was cancelled. And to think no notification was sent
