Swag24USNA,Wed Feb 17 11:16:51 IST 2016,@T_Tackett91 haha it's like 1st grade where you flirt with who you like by pretending to be mean to them
Swag24USNA,Wed Feb 17 11:15:15 IST 2016,"@T_Tackett91 welcome to these fists, four knuckles on your chin. üëä"
Swag24USNA,Tue Feb 16 09:08:58 IST 2016,@JalenElrod personally I think it turned into a very racist organization and racism shouldn't be combatted with more racism.
Swag24USNA,Tue Feb 16 09:01:08 IST 2016,@JalenElrod I know you probably disagree but I don't think Beyonce should have given the nod to the Black Panthers that she did.
Swag24USNA,Tue Feb 16 08:49:52 IST 2016,"@coachbfry yea, he is legit. Like a lot of his music. He has wrote a lot for other artists too."
Swag24USNA,Tue Feb 16 08:45:23 IST 2016,"Turns on Grammy's, sees that Bieber is performing, and turns off Grammy's."
Swag24USNA,Tue Feb 16 08:44:15 IST 2016,@coachbfry well I just turned it on and see Justin Beiber is on so things aren't getting any better...
Swag24USNA,Tue Feb 16 08:43:32 IST 2016,"@JalenElrod serious question, I have no idea? Lol I haven't been watching it"
Swag24USNA,Tue Feb 16 08:41:14 IST 2016,"@coachbfry oh, I'm not watching it. Seen people on my timeline saying white ppl were mad about something that happened and I was curious."
Swag24USNA,Tue Feb 16 08:39:12 IST 2016,So what happened at the Grammy's that has everyone freaking out over Kendrick Lamar?
Swag24USNA,Tue Feb 16 02:23:10 IST 2016,Lavine and Gordon are obviously nowhere near the players Jordan&Dominique were but their dunk contest dunks were at least just as good.
Swag24USNA,Mon Feb 15 22:23:35 IST 2016,RT @CauseWereGuys: Shaq still got it https://t.co/2RkLsR5uCH
Swag24USNA,Mon Feb 15 08:26:33 IST 2016,Never watched the walking dead before but something crazy must have just went down.
Swag24USNA,Mon Feb 15 08:23:08 IST 2016,@T_Tackett91 I'm about to turn Space Jam 2 into a real life documentary üíØ
Swag24USNA,Mon Feb 15 08:22:04 IST 2016,@T_Tackett91 I just hope I get to meet one and then beat his ass in some one on oneüèÄüî•
Swag24USNA,Mon Feb 15 08:20:18 IST 2016,@T_Tackett91 I'm actually getting sent to Roswell New Mexico for a month this Tuesday so I can't see Deadpool while I'm out there lol
Swag24USNA,Mon Feb 15 08:19:36 IST 2016,@T_Tackett91 they'll be replaying it once I get home and he only played half of the first half üòï
Swag24USNA,Mon Feb 15 08:15:23 IST 2016,Trying to decide whether to watch the second half of this all star game or to go see Deadpool...
Swag24USNA,Mon Feb 15 08:14:37 IST 2016,Sting is a legendary band but should not be playing for the halftime of the NBA all-star game.
Swag24USNA,Mon Feb 15 07:38:18 IST 2016,@T_Tackett91 dude Paul George has the ability to be the NBAs best player when he had it going
Swag24USNA,Mon Feb 15 07:36:49 IST 2016,@T_Tackett91 was hoping Kobe could snag this MVP but he only has 3 points right now
Swag24USNA,Mon Feb 15 07:18:42 IST 2016,Hopefully one of these teams breaks 200 points.
Swag24USNA,Mon Feb 15 06:50:25 IST 2016,That had to have been awkward for Drake.
Swag24USNA,Mon Feb 15 06:48:37 IST 2016,Curry didn't know he was supposed to leave the stage lol
Swag24USNA,Mon Feb 15 06:36:46 IST 2016,I have no idea what to think of this all-star game intro.
Swag24USNA,Sun Feb 14 11:37:14 IST 2016,@onlyaub wow like omg aubüòâ
Swag24USNA,Sun Feb 14 11:20:20 IST 2016,Never been a fan of Kid Cudi's pursuit of happiness playing at bars...it puts everyone straight to sleep. #RandomComplaint
Swag24USNA,Sun Feb 14 09:11:49 IST 2016,@JalenElrod Shaq couldn't shoot outside of 7 feet from the basket to save his life but he is one of the best scorers to ever play the game
Swag24USNA,Sun Feb 14 09:11:15 IST 2016,"@JalenElrod when you're talking about a ""shooter"" you mean specifically a jump shot. Scoring can be anything dunks, post moves, floaters ect"
Swag24USNA,Sun Feb 14 09:09:08 IST 2016,Funniest I've ever seen Kevin Love is in this droppin dimes commercial.
Swag24USNA,Sun Feb 14 09:08:09 IST 2016,@JalenElrod I know you didn't play bball so it's probably hard to understand. But being a pure shooter gets ppl paid millions/hall of fame
Swag24USNA,Sun Feb 14 08:55:39 IST 2016,"@JalenElrod it can be a huge difference lolJJ Redick is a better shooter than Lebron, but would you consider him a better scorer than Lebron"
Swag24USNA,Sun Feb 14 08:07:55 IST 2016,Looks like Trump is killing himself attacking George Bush but who knows considering how everything else has seemed to work in his favor..
Swag24USNA,Sun Feb 14 08:01:59 IST 2016,@JalenElrod curry is the best scorer in the game right now. As far as a pure shooter....its up in the air between those two.
Swag24USNA,Sun Feb 14 07:58:02 IST 2016,That's why it's not crazy to say Klay Thompson is a better pure shooter than Curry. Curry definitely better in game shooter though.
Swag24USNA,Sun Feb 14 07:51:02 IST 2016,"I don't see why ppl hate on Shaq, Chuck, Ernie and Kenny announcing on TNT. They are hilarious."
Swag24USNA,Sun Feb 14 07:45:59 IST 2016,@T_Tackett91 lmao I was typing in the chat while you sent this tweet
Swag24USNA,Sun Feb 14 07:45:10 IST 2016,Damn it JJ Redick you let me down.
Swag24USNA,Sun Feb 14 07:41:58 IST 2016,Wow Curry clutched out the end of that round.
Swag24USNA,Sun Feb 14 07:26:00 IST 2016,Ok JJ Redick I picked you to win. Don't let me down.
Swag24USNA,Sun Feb 14 07:24:07 IST 2016,Klay wants this bad.
Swag24USNA,Sun Feb 14 07:21:36 IST 2016,Who does this on a fast break in high school? Lol insane tho. https://t.co/SGmim11b9P
Swag24USNA,Sun Feb 14 06:58:00 IST 2016,Anthony Davis and Demarcus Cousins running out there to congratulate Towns...so many great UK players in the league now.
Swag24USNA,Sun Feb 14 06:01:46 IST 2016,I'm picking J.J. Redick to win tonight 3 point contest.
Swag24USNA,Sun Feb 14 04:43:50 IST 2016,@CxDADDYxFLEX and also coincided exactly with what Einstein theorized a 100 yrs ago and ppl are still trying to prove today
Swag24USNA,Sun Feb 14 04:42:56 IST 2016,@CxDADDYxFLEX can't really see or measure gravity itself to prove things about it. This sound was purely generated from gravity (blackholes)
Swag24USNA,Sun Feb 14 04:41:39 IST 2016,@CxDADDYxFLEX pretty much everything we know about gravity/blackholes are based off how we see it effect things (a falling Apple) but we...
