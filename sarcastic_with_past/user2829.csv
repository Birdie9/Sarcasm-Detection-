habberfied,Fri Jun 26 03:01:07 IST 2015,@SAINTCAREY31 Agreed.
habberfied,Fri Jun 26 03:00:49 IST 2015,"@MightyMax44 Indeed, but it's a high risk move. Would rather a player who's risk is lower, things happen yes, but why play risk game?"
habberfied,Fri Jun 26 02:58:35 IST 2015,"Will Bergevin keep preaching patience and draft a centre, having his coach play him as a winger again or will he trade for one? #habs"
habberfied,Fri Jun 26 02:57:26 IST 2015,"People wanting Skinner, do you want his high chance of repeat and final concussion of his career also? #habs"
habberfied,Thu Jun 25 05:55:00 IST 2015,"Vezina and Lindsay, one more to go Carey. #Habs"

habberfied,Thu Jun 25 04:47:25 IST 2015,"Price wins Lindsay!!!! One down, two to go!! #GoHabsGo  #habs"
habberfied,Thu Jun 25 03:21:27 IST 2015,3-on-3 OT? How about taking away the lost point!
habberfied,Thu Jun 25 03:19:41 IST 2015,"@HABraCHadabra Yes, he actually screamed in anger stipulating that he didn't understand why we picked a goalie when our need was a big C"
habberfied,Thu Jun 25 03:17:54 IST 2015,"@MiaDiCarlo_XO he's always well dressed, like his bud Subban"
habberfied,Thu Jun 25 03:16:14 IST 2015,@HABraCHadabra @mckennaconor actually he was thinking we were going to draft Kopitar
habberfied,Thu Jun 25 03:11:59 IST 2015,RT @mckennaconor: Pierre McGuire told us he doesn't think David Desharnais would get claimed in an expansion draft.
habberfied,Thu Jun 25 03:11:45 IST 2015,"@Mike_Habs Exactly, they want the $ for expansion and short term gain, while other teams suffer monetarily and fan wise."
habberfied,Thu Jun 25 03:09:14 IST 2015,"@Mike_Habs @mckennaconor Hahaha, but yet Galchenyuk ""hasn't shown he's ready to be a centre"" ? Laughable."
habberfied,Thu Jun 25 03:04:43 IST 2015,@Mike_Habs Agreed!
habberfied,Thu Jun 25 03:03:43 IST 2015,The talent pool is already diluted to the point of boring defensive play parody throughout the #NHL why expansion and not relocation? #greed
habberfied,Wed Jun 24 05:06:11 IST 2015,Trade our glorified 2 ND round pick ( 26th pick 1st round ) +++ and get our bonafide 1st line centre. #Habs. Too progressive me thinks.
habberfied,Wed Jun 24 05:02:52 IST 2015,Let's draft a centre.......wait a min.....(Galchenyuk used as a winger) on second thought draft a winger (use as centre ) #Habs
habberfied,Wed Jun 24 03:06:07 IST 2015,"I don't know, maybe give Price more scoring on his team so he doesn't have so much pressure almost every game, just a thought. #Habs"
habberfied,Tue Jun 23 04:24:58 IST 2015,"@p_guay at least he' s not afraid to correct mistakes, unless it's Therrien or Desharnais, then he's afraid"
habberfied,Tue Jun 23 04:20:08 IST 2015,@p_guay if MB did that....might be time to rethink him being our GM
habberfied,Tue Jun 23 04:19:07 IST 2015,@p_guay that would be stupid to say the least
habberfied,Tue Jun 23 02:55:59 IST 2015,@JessaFerra Who says?

habberfied,Mon Jun 22 02:47:23 IST 2015,@SAINTCAREY31 he should start in the AHL anyway

Maybe they've decided to trade …"
habberfied,Sun Jun 21 10:17:10 IST 2015,"@habwild usually I am telling my opinion on what someone has said. I never post rumors because I am not a rumorists,  how would I know?"

habberfied,Sun Jun 21 05:07:48 IST 2015,@scherbak_off Lol indeed
habberfied,Sun Jun 21 05:03:33 IST 2015,"Hey rumorists, to sound plausible, try to invent trades that fit within our system of play, not outlandish stupidity. #Habs"
habberfied,Sun Jun 21 05:01:15 IST 2015,'Cough' Seabrook. #Habs
habberfied,Sun Jun 21 04:59:02 IST 2015,"@24Habsfan @HabsRetweeting True, but neither one of them will be a 1st pairing"
habberfied,Sun Jun 21 04:49:49 IST 2015,@24Habsfan @HabsRetweeting they need some to replace Markov on a pairing with Subban also
habberfied,Sun Jun 21 04:47:52 IST 2015,"@nickcott Probably won't be done, he has balls, he fixed most of his mistakes, not afraid to admit them, needs to grow them me thinks"
