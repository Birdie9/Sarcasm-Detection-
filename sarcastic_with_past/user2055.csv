bhellman,Sun Feb 28 02:42:21 IST 2016,@AGWildcatReport @SportsRadio1290 no guard play.  Can't win close games.  Recipe for a long run in March.  #sarcasm
bhellman,Sun Feb 28 02:38:45 IST 2016,@ghansen711 haven't won a close game all year.  Guard play is terrible.  Tell me again how this means little heading into March?
bhellman,Sun Feb 28 02:31:30 IST 2016,"@MattGOAZCATS we couldn't have thought this team would go far with Gabe, PJC and Kadeem.  Have to rebuild the backcourt"
bhellman,Sun Feb 28 02:26:49 IST 2016,@MattGOAZCATS the guard play on this team continues to be a major problem-can't win late in the year without it
bhellman,Sun Feb 28 02:15:33 IST 2016,@MattGOAZCATS here we go.  Another close one.
bhellman,Sun Feb 28 02:11:44 IST 2016,@MattGOAZCATS PJC is out of it.  Kadeem is out of control.  Gabe can't get anything going.  Guard play.  Can't win without it.
bhellman,Sun Feb 28 02:00:39 IST 2016,@MattGOAZCATS it's not because there was no way it would be for him
bhellman,Fri Feb 26 05:49:31 IST 2016,@BrucePascoe because it doesn't happen to any other school.  @APlayersProgram is the best program in the @pac12 and only team worth storming
bhellman,Thu Feb 25 09:45:40 IST 2016,@MattGOAZCATS 6 losses by 21 total points. Problem with that is 6 losses by 21 total points.  Gotta win some of the close ones.
bhellman,Thu Feb 25 09:32:34 IST 2016,@jerrymeyer247 PG play only thing holding this team back from making a real run.
bhellman,Thu Feb 25 09:28:37 IST 2016,@MattGOAZCATS not sure the Zues reverse layup was the call right there
bhellman,Thu Feb 25 08:49:24 IST 2016,@MattGOAZCATS Miller's been working on that T for a few weeks
bhellman,Thu Feb 25 08:22:49 IST 2016,@MattGOAZCATS PG play.  When it's good it's good but when it's bad it's like this.
bhellman,Fri Feb 19 02:00:38 IST 2016,@ESPNLunardi how is @APlayersProgram 10 in BPI 12 in KenPom but a 5 in your bracketology?
bhellman,Thu Feb 18 10:32:06 IST 2016,"@MattGOAZCATS really interesting how things have changed. PJC is shooting the 3, not turning it over and Kadeem is playing well off the ball"
bhellman,Thu Feb 18 09:39:12 IST 2016,"@MattGOAZCATS 61 in the 2nd half!  This time we actually could've had one of those ""tale of two halves"" games and been ok with it!"
bhellman,Thu Feb 18 09:06:12 IST 2016,@BrucePascoe and he didn't throw up either
bhellman,Thu Feb 18 08:14:01 IST 2016,@AGWildcatReport Ryan Anderson has touched the ball twice on offense but we've taken 8 threes! Who cares if we lead the Conf in %
bhellman,Thu Feb 18 08:13:20 IST 2016,"@MattGOAZCATS Ryan Anderson has touched the ball twice on offense but we've taken 8 threes! They really don't pay attention to the ""details"""
bhellman,Thu Feb 18 08:09:35 IST 2016,@MattGOAZCATS Maybe someone wants to guard the 3 point line since that's all this team does
bhellman,Thu Feb 18 08:06:15 IST 2016,@MattGOAZCATS There's absolutely no sense of urgency
bhellman,Thu Feb 18 08:05:00 IST 2016,@MattGOAZCATS this is our problem all year.  We drift in and out of games.
bhellman,Tue Feb 16 09:59:36 IST 2016,@tiffanybelling oh Tiffers
bhellman,Tue Feb 16 09:16:39 IST 2016,"RT @JackCurryYES: To pay tribute to Bowie, I would've  picked Morrissey or Bryan Ferry or Peter Gabriel or Iggy Pop or David Byrne. Well, yâ€¦"
bhellman,Tue Feb 16 07:14:37 IST 2016,@tiffanybelling assumed someone like you would get it without :)
bhellman,Tue Feb 16 07:09:43 IST 2016,@tiffanybelling not with Stevie Wonder at the piano there aren't
bhellman,Tue Feb 16 07:06:29 IST 2016,@tiffanybelling she did that Xmas commercial that was on like a million times
bhellman,Tue Feb 16 02:44:31 IST 2016,@ESPNLunardi saw your Bracket. Zona wins 5 in a row and you move them down a spot?  Still 3 seeds below Oregon who just lost 2 in a row?
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 09:31:09 IST 2016,@billzz75 @SethDavisHoops could go out in the opening weekend just as easily too.  Not even Miller knows what team will show game to game
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 09:28:24 IST 2016,@MattGOAZCATS yup. He knows they can go out at anytime in the Pac12 or NCAA or they can get on a good run.  Gotta be very frustrating
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 09:25:20 IST 2016,"@MattGOAZCATS I'm kind of tired of Miller having to use the ""tale of two halves"" line every game."
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 09:23:23 IST 2016,@WildcatHoops getting tired of this whole tale of two halves story every game
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 08:55:19 IST 2016,"@MattGOAZCATS 21-5, tied for 1st. No bad losses. Injuries.  Millers really pieced this thing together. Maybe his best job considering all."
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 08:47:42 IST 2016,@SethDavisHoops thanks for waiting on Zona.  Flawed team but have battled lately especially with the full roster in place
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 08:42:08 IST 2016,@MattGOAZCATS man that was an ugly half but a huge win.  This is who we are.  Score a lot.  Give up a lot.  Battle.
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 08:27:32 IST 2016,@SethDavisHoops waiting on the Zona-SC finish?
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 08:22:15 IST 2016,@GottliebShow  totally different Zona team this year.  Never in a million years would you see them blow 16 pt. lead at home before this yr
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 08:16:31 IST 2016,@MattGOAZCATS 32 points in 12 minutes!  Have to be able to put 2 halves together at some point
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 08:04:04 IST 2016,@MattGOAZCATS Shooting way too many 3s with a double digit lead
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 07:49:17 IST 2016,@AGWildcatReport exactly.  Missed those early 3s then figured it out
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 07:45:41 IST 2016,@AGWildcatReport started the first half shooting too many 3s too.  Pretty sure not what Miller wanted
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 07:31:38 IST 2016,@MattGOAZCATS the question is does Miller know how to coach this team when they have a lead at half? Ha!
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 06:58:49 IST 2016,@MattGOAZCATS would be nice to knock down a few though!
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 06:54:22 IST 2016,@MattGOAZCATS here's an idea...keep pounding it inside and stop shooting 3s!
bhellman,Sun Feb 14 04:46:32 IST 2016,@MattGOAZCATS and look who is tied in the loss column all of a sudden!  Huge game tomorrow
bhellman,Sat Feb 13 09:42:19 IST 2016,"@MattGOAZCATS winning a game shooting like that from the floor, from 3 and from the line is not something I thought they could do-big win"
bhellman,Wed Feb 10 05:40:31 IST 2016,@milessimon wasn't my point
bhellman,Wed Feb 10 05:27:01 IST 2016,@milessimon come on!  You spent 3 years in McKale!
bhellman,Mon Feb 08 08:37:00 IST 2016,@KirkHerbstreit @Broncos he'll get no credit for this win.  Almost like having an asterisk because of how bad he was
bhellman,Mon Feb 08 08:29:28 IST 2016,@Nurse_wkbw he left that drive in 2012
