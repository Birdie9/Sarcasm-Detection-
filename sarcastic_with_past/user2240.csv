FrankRizzoForUS,Sat Feb 27 00:11:21 IST 2016,"@DC_Kearsley @navyCA139 a good deal, not a failed cause like Cruz's petty attempt to stop Obamacare which failed."
FrankRizzoForUS,Fri Feb 26 23:59:38 IST 2016,@pambesteder @neojosemo Not at all the media has painted Trump as a racist - not true if you research. Blacks know he will bring jobs back
FrankRizzoForUS,Fri Feb 26 23:57:50 IST 2016,@navyCA139 @DC_Kearsley The only memorable thing about Cruz in Senate besides how hated he is the time he fought Obamacare and failed!
FrankRizzoForUS,Fri Feb 26 23:56:53 IST 2016,"@navyCA139 @DC_Kearsley HELLO Ted Cruz is already in the Senate how the hell is he an outsider? He calls it a cartel, he is a part of it"
FrankRizzoForUS,Fri Feb 26 23:56:15 IST 2016,@navyCA139 @DC_Kearsley Ted Cruz doesn't expose anything except how much of a fraud he is - what has he done for us in Washington?
