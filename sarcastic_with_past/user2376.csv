MoonVertigoYEG,Thu Feb 25 20:19:57 IST 2016,@PaqTwinn Dreger said this morning that Larsen wanted back into the NHL but had no interest in returning to this organization.
MoonVertigoYEG,Thu Feb 25 20:08:32 IST 2016,@pipefitter34 I don't want to see RNH moved. I see a Pens set up at centre. McDavid (Sid) Draisaitl (Malkin - not as good) RNH (Staal).
MoonVertigoYEG,Thu Feb 25 20:07:19 IST 2016,@pipefitter34 Agreed. It's not the end of the world. Sens became an elite team within a scant few years while screwing up the Daigle pick.
