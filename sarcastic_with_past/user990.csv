gretawhy,Fri Jan 15 00:10:12 IST 2016,@sosodeformed I think invitro tests are hella invasive. So he might have been nice and thought it's easier after the baby is born.
gretawhy,Fri Jan 15 00:02:04 IST 2016,@sosodeformed I hope he was just being nice by not getting an invitro paternity test and gets one done before agreeing to that. That's crazy
gretawhy,Thu Jan 14 23:57:56 IST 2016,"@sosodeformed $58,000. That's TWELVE MILLION dollars by the time the baby is 18. But no. She's not a gold digger. She's out of her damn mind"
gretawhy,Thu Jan 14 23:42:47 IST 2016,@reneenecole Direct boss does not. Which is maybe why she stayed.
gretawhy,Thu Jan 14 23:38:59 IST 2016,@reneenecole I mean. My direct boss didn't go? But still. He would have left me here ALONE? I told Eric last night I bet he'd do it.
gretawhy,Thu Jan 14 23:08:53 IST 2016,"Big boss is here for mtg w salesmen. Took them all out to lunch, asked my direct boss to go but not me? Nice. Let us close for an hour to go"

gretawhy,Wed Jan 13 20:08:36 IST 2016,It's killing my germaphobe boss that I'm here today. I sneeze and I practically feel her cringing.
