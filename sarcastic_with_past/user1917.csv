blizzardof96,Sun Feb 28 21:39:43 IST 2016,Clear cut. Easy forecast. Really easy forecast. #sarcasm #Onstorm #12zGFS https://t.co/2ZlC5tZU5p
blizzardof96,Sun Feb 28 20:13:26 IST 2016,Keeping an eye on a significant system Tues eve into Wed morning. P-type uncertain at this point but leaning frozen. #Onstorm
blizzardof96,Sun Feb 28 01:20:20 IST 2016,Favourite word in the weather world: potential.
blizzardof96,Sun Feb 28 00:33:17 IST 2016,You know you live too far North when there's no radar coverage in your area.
blizzardof96,Sun Feb 28 00:29:04 IST 2016,@PQuinlanGlobal Really intense banding on EC radar. Max dbz coming in near 50. Crazy!
blizzardof96,Wed Feb 24 19:11:17 IST 2016,Heavy snow band moving N through the City of Toronto. Visibility will drop substantially. Changeover 11am-2pm. https://t.co/INMsnauaO5
blizzardof96,Wed Feb 24 18:16:05 IST 2016,"Conditions will deteriorate quickly across the GTA this morning. Snow will intensify, mix with ice pellets and turn to RN 11am-2pm. #onstorm"
blizzardof96,Wed Feb 24 05:52:33 IST 2016,"@LindeMorris Not a huge diff in my opinion. After the noon hour it's all rain. Up to 3"" possible on front side. Back side as well(thurs)."
blizzardof96,Wed Feb 24 05:47:25 IST 2016,"GTA: Wet snow starts ~7am tomorrow morning. It lasts until 10am-noon, then changes over to moderate rain. More snow thurs morning. #Onstorm"
blizzardof96,Tue Feb 23 09:48:28 IST 2016,@timhickton Mix between the two... similar to the 12z Euro. Low confidence at the moment.
blizzardof96,Tue Feb 23 09:40:07 IST 2016,"2 model ""camps"" right now. SREF/GFS/UK take the low west of Toronto. The NAM/RGEM/EURO take it SE. Diff between all rain and sig SN/RN mix."
blizzardof96,Tue Feb 23 08:29:26 IST 2016,@ottawavalleywx It won't be. If the back end deformation band pans out(NAM/EC show this) that would have a 10:1 ratio.
blizzardof96,Tue Feb 23 08:28:15 IST 2016,@stribe39 It looks very similar to 18z. A slight shift SE if anything.
blizzardof96,Tue Feb 23 08:20:53 IST 2016,"0z NAM continues to support a nasty situation for GTA starting Wed aft + continuing through much of Thurs. Mix of RN and heavy, wet snow."
blizzardof96,Tue Feb 23 07:07:22 IST 2016,@LindeMorris The recent run is the snowiest yet for YYZ. Be careful with it as the snow algorithm isn't great. It tends to follow OP.
blizzardof96,Tue Feb 23 07:04:00 IST 2016,It would surprise me if the 0z GFS does not tick east. Ensembles tightly clustered with a track from CMH-ERI-BUF. #Onstorm
blizzardof96,Tue Feb 23 06:43:58 IST 2016,@AndyBlizzard87 If a NAM/Euro track works out(this is essential) then the layer btwn 750-850mb needs to cool to 0c. That would do it.
blizzardof96,Tue Feb 23 06:40:32 IST 2016,@LindeMorris Not really. The thermals on the NAM are much more supportive of snow. The euro has warmer Sfc t's. Makes a big diff.
blizzardof96,Tue Feb 23 06:39:23 IST 2016,"The toughest part of the forecast is the warm frontal precip. IMO, it's a mix of both rain and snow. %'s yet to be figured out. #onstorm"
blizzardof96,Tue Feb 23 06:37:00 IST 2016,"The area of highest confidence relates to the backend snow early Thursday. This should drop at least 2"" on TO. Could be more. #Onstorm"
blizzardof96,Tue Feb 23 06:33:08 IST 2016,"Models are not in great agreement on snowfall/rain amounts. E.g: 18z NAM COBB has 10.8""(8:1 mean ratio) while GFS has 1-3"" at YYZ. #onstorm"
blizzardof96,Tue Feb 23 06:31:08 IST 2016,Some ice pellets are possible but I do not expect any freezing rain for the GTA. Warm layer is very shallow. #Onstorm
blizzardof96,Tue Feb 23 06:29:02 IST 2016,"The Wed-Thurs #Onstorm will not contain an ""icy mix"". It is likely a Rain/Snow scenario with nearly isothermal level from 1000-700mb."
blizzardof96,Sun Feb 21 08:15:53 IST 2016,RT @bradrousseau: Tracking possible winter storm for #onwx Wednesday through Thursday. Details here on where the forecast is tracking. http…
blizzardof96,Sun Feb 21 02:35:40 IST 2016,@dbmlandscaping Half a foot. Yes.
blizzardof96,Sun Feb 21 02:19:25 IST 2016,RT @Met_mdclark: European ensembles locking in on a snow threat mid week. Confidence SLOWLY increasing. #ilwx #inwx #ohwx
blizzardof96,Sun Feb 21 02:18:29 IST 2016,The 12z European Ensemble mean has over 1/2' of wet snow for the GTA with the midweek system. #Onstorm
blizzardof96,Sat Feb 20 22:13:48 IST 2016,@CerebralV0rtex Agree. Link for the IO relationship?
blizzardof96,Sat Feb 20 21:28:24 IST 2016,Day 4-6 Snow/sleet maps from WPC. Valid 7am Tues to 7am Friday. https://t.co/noQYVDPMk7
blizzardof96,Sat Feb 20 21:23:52 IST 2016,@AndyBlizzard87 It's okay if we disagree. Nothing apocalyptic but believe significant system is likely. People should be aware 5 days out.
blizzardof96,Sat Feb 20 21:09:28 IST 2016,"Until spread narrows, cannot pinpoint location of +SN swath. Regardless, this will be a high impact storm with power outage risks. #Onstorm"
blizzardof96,Sat Feb 20 21:03:05 IST 2016,NWS hazard map shows risk of heavy snow/high winds for S/E Ontario midweek. +SN zone will be narrow. #Onstorm https://t.co/pYMlHXnmLH
blizzardof96,Sat Feb 20 02:52:06 IST 2016,RT @DanLeonard_wx: ECMWF EPS: Monster storm but we're hemorrhaging members to the cutter camp. Down to 30% offshore track. https://t.co/cai…
blizzardof96,Sat Feb 20 02:09:05 IST 2016,"@stribe39 Despite GEFS guidance, not overly concerned about RN. Mixing possible if track is far enough W but have that nice banana high."
blizzardof96,Sat Feb 20 02:02:58 IST 2016,Good summary of 12z Ensemble guidance. All over the place right now. https://t.co/7rZbMxd8NZ
blizzardof96,Sat Feb 20 02:02:02 IST 2016,12z GEFS has furthest W track. EPS has primary W of Apps(LA--N AL--E OH) with redevelopment along coastal plain. GEPS further SE. #Onstorm
blizzardof96,Sat Feb 20 01:56:47 IST 2016,Watching major storm potential Wed-Thurs of next week. Details need to be ironed out but good chance low tracks inland. #Onstorm
blizzardof96,Thu Feb 18 08:08:01 IST 2016,@enmweather @JayScotland The nipher is a major issue. #'s at YYZ are inconsistent with N GTA amounts. It does fine w/ wet SN.
blizzardof96,Wed Feb 17 05:23:37 IST 2016,Incredible totals. #Onstorm https://t.co/wVFIKVDL1A
blizzardof96,Tue Feb 16 18:16:48 IST 2016,Light-Moderate snow continues for the GTA today. It tapers off between 2-4pm. Will be very close to 10cm when all is said and done. #onstorm
blizzardof96,Tue Feb 16 08:04:15 IST 2016,Forecasting QPF along NW side of low can be tough when gradient sets up like this. #razor #onstorm https://t.co/T6pe6y2Zn1
blizzardof96,Tue Feb 16 07:56:09 IST 2016,"The LP centre looks to track east of the consensus from this morning. My revised forecast has 2-5"" for the GTA. SN expected for AM rush."
blizzardof96,Tue Feb 16 00:29:02 IST 2016,@boyderland Thanks. I appreciate it.
blizzardof96,Tue Feb 16 00:28:43 IST 2016,@WXRISKCOM Obviously. I think current system is a good example of this.
blizzardof96,Tue Feb 16 00:12:53 IST 2016,Don't trust the ECM inside 24hrs. It's very good in the medium range with big picture but tends to leave out important short term details.
blizzardof96,Mon Feb 15 23:57:59 IST 2016,The snow is expected to taper off around 3-6pm tomorrow. I will try to update numbers later tonight if thoughts change. #onstorm
blizzardof96,Mon Feb 15 23:54:59 IST 2016,"Currently expecting 4-7"" of snow for the City of Toronto. Moderate snow starts ~5am and quickly becomes heavy. Tough morning rush. #Onstorm"
blizzardof96,Mon Feb 15 22:55:31 IST 2016,"Two main model clusters from the 12z suite. NAM/RGEM/GFS/UK have 3-6"" of snow for GTA. RAP/HRRRX have 6-9"". #Onstorm"
blizzardof96,Mon Feb 15 22:51:52 IST 2016,@ChrisScottWx Agree. Strong moisture transport with 700mb confluence axis should allow deformation zone to form. Strengthening area of LP.
blizzardof96,Mon Feb 15 22:43:52 IST 2016,@ChrisScottWx Razor sharp gradient on NW side of the low. As tough as it gets.
