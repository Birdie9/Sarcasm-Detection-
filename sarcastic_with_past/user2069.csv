juwallner,Sun Feb 21 07:29:05 IST 2016,This Trump speech is everything. (Everything nuts)
juwallner,Sun Feb 21 07:16:15 IST 2016,"I will say, as a staffer, I have been in the room on more than one losing night. It sucks for staff, family & volunteers. Never easy."
juwallner,Sun Feb 21 07:13:47 IST 2016,Maybe Jeb! Would have done better if he had kept the glasses. There's no shame in glasses.
juwallner,Sun Feb 21 06:06:21 IST 2016,"Only in Vegas... Sen. Reid's presser location includes the phrase ""past the fire-breathing praying mantis"""
juwallner,Sat Feb 20 00:40:04 IST 2016,At least this time the coffee I spilled on my desk went AWAY from my computer. #winning
juwallner,Tue Feb 16 07:56:22 IST 2016,"My ""Grammy Moment"" may involve the mute button or earplugs until I see Adele and her bob walk onto that stage"
juwallner,Tue Feb 16 07:55:20 IST 2016,Seriously. Who are all of these people? And where are Adele and Gaga?
juwallner,Tue Feb 16 06:46:39 IST 2016,"OK So I only want to see Gaga, Adele and Hamilton. Any chance those three can happen in the next 30 minutes so I can skip the rest?!"
juwallner,Tue Feb 16 01:17:32 IST 2016,"I'm sorry, did Trump just say the proof point that he handles pressure well is that he has won lots of club tournaments? Golf? Seriously?"
juwallner,Sun Feb 14 20:46:17 IST 2016,It may be Valentine's Day but I think Trump and Cruz have officially broken up. Wow.
juwallner,Sun Feb 14 09:18:37 IST 2016,"Kasich said ""the lord"" three times in 60 second closing"
juwallner,Sun Feb 14 09:10:42 IST 2016,I think the next debate should be held in a middle school cafeteria to match the maturity level of these candidates.
juwallner,Sun Feb 14 08:41:52 IST 2016,Best. Debate. Ever. The crowd. The candidates. All of it. Just amazing.
juwallner,Sun Feb 14 08:33:10 IST 2016,@matthewamiller first aired during super bowl. Amazing right?!
juwallner,Sun Feb 14 08:30:58 IST 2016,YES! The Mike Tyson Michael and Son jingle just aired during GOP debate. Just when I thought it couldn't get any better!
juwallner,Sun Feb 14 08:26:40 IST 2016,I wonder if Ben Carson takes Tylenol PM before debates.
juwallner,Sun Feb 14 08:02:46 IST 2016,Big mistake not to have audience silence rules tonight. This is getting ridiculous
juwallner,Sun Feb 14 07:41:32 IST 2016,The president has ONE FULL QUARTER of his term left. How is it NOT appropriate for him to nominate the next justice? INSANITY
juwallner,Sun Feb 14 07:39:38 IST 2016,Who exactly are these people the GOP say would be unanimous? Senate GOP wouldn't even confirm the Pope in this day and age!
juwallner,Sun Feb 14 07:35:05 IST 2016,Rubio only candidate I saw do sign of the cross during moment of silence. Of course I'm not suggesting that was calculated in any way...
juwallner,Sun Feb 14 07:16:21 IST 2016,It is NOT breaking news that a President with 11 months left in office will nominate a justice. It is constitutional duty & 100% appropriate
juwallner,Sat Feb 13 03:21:36 IST 2016,Interesting. Just played a round of Words with Friends (I admit it) and was fed a Right to Rise ad attacking Trump.
juwallner,Fri Feb 12 07:26:42 IST 2016,"For a DC girl, choosing between Scandal and the debate is pretty tough... What would Olivia do?!"
juwallner,Wed Feb 10 08:43:09 IST 2016,"I work in politics & read lots of news, but there are moments like tonight when I wonder if this Trump thing is just a long joke/nightmare"
juwallner,Wed Feb 10 07:52:29 IST 2016,"Hillary should give this speech over and over again. Strongest I've heard from her in a while, most natural and speaks to all of us."
juwallner,Mon Feb 08 07:11:00 IST 2016,I'll say it. The Bruno / Beyoncé dance off was fun. Best part of an otherwise meh halftime show.
juwallner,Mon Feb 08 07:09:29 IST 2016,What was Chris Martin doing that dance off? Just spinning and jumping around somewhere off camera??
juwallner,Mon Feb 08 06:55:13 IST 2016,I hope everyone in the DC market just saw Mike Tyson singing the Michael & Son HVAC theme song. It was bizarre and amazing.
juwallner,Sun Feb 07 08:42:02 IST 2016,"Christie should probably take the word ""bridges"" out of his vocabulary."
juwallner,Sun Feb 07 07:54:50 IST 2016,His worst debate yet. No question.  https://t.co/VlRQ4ZwXio
juwallner,Sun Feb 07 07:37:55 IST 2016,This is officially my favorite debate yet. Hands down.
juwallner,Sun Feb 07 07:26:10 IST 2016,I assume Chris Christie's debate prep is just the Gov and a guy playing Rubio right? No need for the rest of them. #throwdowninNH
juwallner,Sun Feb 07 07:03:24 IST 2016,Christie doing WAY better than Rubio in this exchange. Fun to watch.
juwallner,Fri Feb 05 07:40:18 IST 2016,"""A progressive is someone who makes progress."" Such a strong opening. Good - and doable - policy proposals are key. #imwithher"
juwallner,Thu Feb 04 00:30:43 IST 2016,Or maybe at the next undercard debate Jim Gilmore (WHO?) can stand on the stage alone and introduce himself.
juwallner,Thu Feb 04 00:29:56 IST 2016,"So with Paul, Santorum and Huckabee gone, have we finally come to the end of the undercard debate??"
juwallner,Tue Feb 02 07:35:29 IST 2016,"CNN: ""I can't tell you how exciting this is. We're watching them count."" They should just air Bourdain rerun until results are actually in!"
juwallner,Fri Jan 29 08:35:28 IST 2016,Ok. I have to admit the Cruz immigration montage is fun tv.
juwallner,Fri Jan 29 08:20:20 IST 2016,Pick any budget item to eliminate and Christie says Planned Parenthood. Reason #482 why I'm a Democrat. Unbelievable.
juwallner,Fri Jan 29 08:00:32 IST 2016,This is not a Cruz crowd. Nope. Not at all.
juwallner,Fri Jan 29 07:56:47 IST 2016,So torn between the networks right now... So much crazy to choose from.
juwallner,Wed Jan 27 05:11:51 IST 2016,Watching Trump berate reporters at his own press conference is fascinating. I just can't change the channel...

juwallner,Sun Jan 24 09:24:12 IST 2016,I finally realized that Scandal must just be on winter hiatus so that Fitz can campaign full-time for Hillary in Iowa. I support that.
juwallner,Sat Jan 23 05:43:23 IST 2016,I wonder how many people will order Showtime during the blizzard. Only 3 inches on the ground and we just did! Time to binge lots of shows.
juwallner,Sat Jan 23 02:31:09 IST 2016,There is nothing i love more than local news during a storm. I held out as long as I could but just turned it on. Bring on Pat Collins!
juwallner,Fri Jan 22 23:32:27 IST 2016,First flakes are falling - which means DC should start to panic in 3-2-1....
