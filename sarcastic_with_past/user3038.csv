White54Dustin,Thu Jun 04 06:22:13 IST 2015,The Lady Gators came to play today! #SEC
White54Dustin,Wed Jun 03 21:51:14 IST 2015,As a coach without discipline in your players you will not be successful. As a teacher it works the same. Your students need discipline to.
White54Dustin,Wed Jun 03 03:06:16 IST 2015,Apparently all a birds goal in life is to crap on a clean vehicle!!
White54Dustin,Wed Jun 03 00:10:40 IST 2015,"People say that things happen for a reason. That may be true in some cases, but sometimes things happen because you let them happen!"

White54Dustin,Tue Jun 02 01:28:21 IST 2015,So UAB decides to reinstate their football program after they have already lost all of their coaches and players. That was smart.
White54Dustin,Mon Jun 01 08:50:36 IST 2015,I just don't care to much for some people.
White54Dustin,Sun May 31 09:59:24 IST 2015,I'll find a good movie here shortly to watch if things keep going this way.
White54Dustin,Sun May 31 09:34:50 IST 2015,I do not understand why in an elimination game you do not start your best pitcher. Littlejohn is really good but Osorio is a beast!!!
White54Dustin,Sun May 31 08:57:32 IST 2015,"Now that this game is over, let's see if the @AlabamaSB team can take care of lsu!! #RollTide #GRIT"
White54Dustin,Sun May 31 08:47:43 IST 2015,One of the best softball games I have ever seen and it ends in a dang walk off walk. Come on man! Or women lol

White54Dustin,Thu May 28 05:31:49 IST 2015,I do believe that my 2nd calling in life besides being a teacher and coach would have to be as a Grill Master. Call me Chef Heavy.
White54Dustin,Wed May 27 08:04:56 IST 2015,It would have been a better game if the Hawks showed up tonight. This is damn embarrassing.
White54Dustin,Tue May 26 20:35:32 IST 2015,I will take a scotch and water hold the scotch.
White54Dustin,Mon May 25 07:22:26 IST 2015,They are getting mad at a guy for playing hard and hustling. The NBA is already the softest league ever god forbid they hustle.
White54Dustin,Sun May 24 08:31:34 IST 2015,"Father just made a valid point, ""If you make millions and millions of dollars in the NBA your ass should be able to hit a free throw."" True."

White54Dustin,Sat May 23 08:01:03 IST 2015,@epratt11 Can't let other people's stupidity get to you. You do you boo boo and it'll all be ok :)
White54Dustin,Fri May 22 22:41:29 IST 2015,S/O to the mom teaching her son how to fish at the park today. Future fisherman!
White54Dustin,Fri May 22 08:43:20 IST 2015,Dwight Howard is probably one of the most overrated players in NBA history.
