ladyofwreck,Sat Nov 21 06:03:26 IST 2015,You know... I think I'm gonna end up bingeing on South Park now. Just what I need... #sarcastic
ladyofwreck,Sat Nov 21 06:02:24 IST 2015,@Bullycon I think just listening helps. Having kids is hard.
ladyofwreck,Sat Nov 21 06:01:32 IST 2015,So often I really want to just say this... to infinity.  https://t.co/LCGqHPePY1
ladyofwreck,Sat Nov 21 05:58:07 IST 2015,USA educational system is seriously EFFFED (to the EFed) up. And no Common Core blah is gonna fix it. =P
ladyofwreck,Sat Nov 21 05:54:45 IST 2015,if they say the wrong thing and the district decides to take it out on them. GRRR!
ladyofwreck,Sat Nov 21 05:54:21 IST 2015,And once you start down that road the school staff just button up and become difficult to manage because their JOBS could be threatened
ladyofwreck,Sat Nov 21 05:53:40 IST 2015,I mean I could do it if I knew what I was doing but U have to have the right wording and verb-age and there are loop holes.. meh!
ladyofwreck,Sat Nov 21 05:52:36 IST 2015,something that I'm still trying to figure out. I may actually have to hire a child advocate to do this to make things happen. How messed up?
ladyofwreck,Sat Nov 21 05:49:28 IST 2015,..that's gonna be a challenge. And I'm not even sure if it *IS* the right fit for him either. Cuz AZ law has a least restrictive environment
ladyofwreck,Sat Nov 21 05:48:33 IST 2015,"I mean there actually might be a school for middle #wrecklets extreme behavioral issues, but getting the school district to send him there.."
ladyofwreck,Sat Nov 21 05:46:45 IST 2015,@CadusBane lol yeah... I did see that panel. I totally need to catch up.
ladyofwreck,Sat Nov 21 05:45:36 IST 2015,Whether by a stupid disease or fate of behavioral issues.. I have no control over any of this! #frustrated
ladyofwreck,Sat Nov 21 05:44:38 IST 2015,You want ur kids to have things better than u did. You want them to have better opportunities. I honestly feel like they can't have it.
ladyofwreck,Sat Nov 21 05:43:45 IST 2015,No real answers. No fixes. Just ride it out and work UBER hard for more of the same no answers. I just feel like I'm totally failing them.
ladyofwreck,Sat Nov 21 05:41:02 IST 2015,I honestly wanna just go back to bed. Dealing w/ #wrecklet issues just takes any amount of fight out of me. I can't fix anything. =P
ladyofwreck,Sat Nov 21 05:36:24 IST 2015,@HMRC4EVR It's just that easy. Actually it would help fix a lot of problems. Why stop at 2? I could get away with more I'm sure!
ladyofwreck,Sat Nov 21 05:35:38 IST 2015,Also finally took middle #wrecklet to psychiatrist. I'm completely overwhelmed. I don't wanna adult anymore today.

ladyofwreck,Wed Nov 18 05:51:34 IST 2015,@BeatlesDiva he is your evil twin just like Claudia is mine. I've been getting calls for her for about the same amount of time.
ladyofwreck,Wed Nov 18 05:25:02 IST 2015,@HMRC4EVR further more 4 his issues spanking would only make him worse. =\ He's oppositional defiant. We are seeing a psychiatrist fri.
ladyofwreck,Wed Nov 18 05:12:24 IST 2015,@HMRC4EVR yeah we don't spank #wrecklets but it will severely wreck his Christmas and extra curricular activities this season.
ladyofwreck,Wed Nov 18 04:20:46 IST 2015,So middle #wrecklet got himself suspended from school today. FML!
ladyofwreck,Wed Nov 18 04:19:56 IST 2015,@Wanzerfan I did not hear that but I am intrigued!!
ladyofwreck,Wed Nov 18 04:02:38 IST 2015,@Wanzerfan the first 3 were awesome. The heritage only slightly less so.
