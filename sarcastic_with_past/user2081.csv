SoilManJoe,Wed Jan 27 18:39:36 IST 2016,@MaddeverAndrew @farmer_benn there will be a value to improved structure and exudates put into the soil plus soil protection from elements
SoilManJoe,Wed Jan 27 18:38:19 IST 2016,"@MaddeverAndrew @farmer_benn agreed, but surely can recoup some of cost for seed from grazing? and muck isnt the only benefit gained"
SoilManJoe,Wed Jan 27 17:08:09 IST 2016,@farmer_benn then to top it off does this then stimulate a large influx of root exudates into the soil to boost your soil biology levels?
