alyssaclandez,Wed Apr 22 07:26:49 IST 2015,Ugh I'm sorry. I can't stand seeing flat-footed movements & contemporary in romantic tutus. Save them for nutcracker snow corps. #DanceMoms
alyssaclandez,Wed Apr 22 07:21:09 IST 2015,"Abby.. You gave Kendall the most BORING solo on earth, whether she forgot or not. That damn thing she danced with was too big. #DanceMoms"
alyssaclandez,Wed Apr 22 07:12:22 IST 2015,I commend Jojo for this dance. That's some great core & leg strength there. #DanceMoms
alyssaclandez,Wed Apr 22 07:06:58 IST 2015,If u can't handle competition w/ 1 person ur not ready to compete w/ the entire music industry. Kendal could maybe. Jill can't. #DanceMoms
alyssaclandez,Wed Apr 22 07:03:02 IST 2015,Abby & Jill are their own worst enemies. They create their own stress & act like children & blame it on others. #DanceMoms HOLLY IS RIGHT.
alyssaclandez,Wed Apr 22 07:00:33 IST 2015,"Holly's ""people"" should want the vid to make a great vid. ITS THEIR JOB! #DanceMoms"
alyssaclandez,Wed Apr 22 06:57:28 IST 2015,I think this is the most ive tweeted during #DanceMoms. Probably cuz I can't stand how these women are acting & I think Nia deserves some 👏🏼
alyssaclandez,Wed Apr 22 06:56:02 IST 2015,Dont be so jelly Jill. Admit u should have found someone else for the vid. U said yourself Abby doesnt have Aubreys connections. #DanceMoms
alyssaclandez,Wed Apr 22 06:48:47 IST 2015,I'm excited to see @realniasioux's video. I've always thought this girl was a rock star. & @AubreyODay is so sweet & loving. #DanceMoms 💕
alyssaclandez,Wed Apr 22 06:45:07 IST 2015,"Abby should think before calling everyone she works w/ her ""friend"". It's so fake. #DanceMoms"
alyssaclandez,Wed Apr 22 06:28:09 IST 2015,Own your words. You'll get caught eventually. When you do it will get 10 times worse the reaction than if you were to admit it the 1st time.
