Cornice_Trading,Wed Feb 24 22:17:18 IST 2016,First LNG export shipping today? Look at the MASSIVE boost that extra demand has given #natgas prices!!! #sarcasm
Cornice_Trading,Wed Feb 24 21:46:27 IST 2016,"@DigStic Agreed if they take it. We are Arsenal, known to fail in agonizing ways. See: yesterday #frustrating"
Cornice_Trading,Wed Feb 24 21:38:50 IST 2016,"@DigStic Pretty funny bc we are not a big team, but very true. Only Bayern stands a chance against Barca, and even them... Barca too good"
Cornice_Trading,Wed Feb 24 21:37:58 IST 2016,"@DigStic Arsenal played really well for first 70 minutes. Barcelona is SO good though, just takes them one chance, SO clinical!"
Cornice_Trading,Wed Feb 24 21:26:06 IST 2016,"@DigStic Sorry, I know you're busy with $CL_F. I'm bitter, told you I'm a sore loser. Somehow was ok yesterday but really stings today"
Cornice_Trading,Wed Feb 24 21:13:58 IST 2016,@DigStic Fight Giroud? Really?!? You're 4 foot nothing. Would love to see that one play out in a back alley somewhere
Cornice_Trading,Wed Feb 24 21:13:21 IST 2016,"@DigStic Not sure what Jordi Alba was thinking. Never liked him, he dives like a wuss, but he could have seen red. https://t.co/EMFkFWQzT7"
Cornice_Trading,Wed Feb 24 09:23:05 IST 2016,"@DigStic not much to say. Apparently Messi > Ox, who knew. Gotta take your chances against a better team. Hopefully my boys do better tmrw"

Cornice_Trading,Fri Feb 19 20:20:55 IST 2016,"This is exactly what I talked about yesterday. @agurevich23 gets it, so many don't understand how to use options https://t.co/bYEkGpo6ek"
Cornice_Trading,Fri Feb 19 01:44:24 IST 2016,@DigStic Definitely! Something extra sweet about those last second goals. The Leicester red card was harsh but so was the PK they got
Cornice_Trading,Fri Feb 19 01:37:48 IST 2016,@DigStic I will watch live and fear/anticipate not wanting to mention/think of the game ever again once it's over #COYG #RespectBarca

Cornice_Trading,Fri Feb 19 00:33:17 IST 2016,"@ettle_cw @degiorgiod I know, seems unlikely but it's #natgas. I built my #PolarVortex machine for these types of scenarios. All risk/reward"
Cornice_Trading,Fri Feb 19 00:23:28 IST 2016,"@degiorgiod Generally go other way if I'm bullish, buy futes and puts and sell calls, this is purely expiry winger (ie probably bad trade)"
Cornice_Trading,Fri Feb 19 00:22:09 IST 2016,@degiorgiod Vol is pricey given realized but I'm a sucker for wingers. Closed my short futes pre # and bot $2 call for $0.013 just now

Cornice_Trading,Tue Feb 16 20:22:56 IST 2016,Big reason I believe options are key part of good trading strategies: leverage they provide allows you to weather stop runs #RiskManagement

Cornice_Trading,Fri Feb 12 21:52:57 IST 2016,@BollingShane Obviously today is an outlier and vol harder to scalp when move is one-way but this short squeeze opens up $24 target IMHO

I do love this shit, even on 3 hours of sleep for the week."
