charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 22:37:52 IST 2015,"@candidateross @FoxNews tell me, does this hate your showing me follow the teaching of Jesus? Lol"
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 22:37:30 IST 2015,@candidateross @FoxNews sounds like a quranic verse.
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 22:37:11 IST 2015,@candidateross @FoxNews you sound radical. Listen to yourself. Lol. I'm going to burn in hell forever because I disagree with you.
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 22:36:38 IST 2015,@candidateross he tells them they are transgressing the law by not killing these people. That's what he says.
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 22:36:02 IST 2015,@candidateross I don't have a religion.
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 22:31:25 IST 2015,@candidateross @FoxNews here. Let me quote it word for word for you.
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 22:30:52 IST 2015,@candidateross @FoxNews so Jesus is going to kill anyone who merely disbelieves he exists. Sounds appalling to me. Real immoral murderer.
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 22:29:43 IST 2015,@candidateross @FoxNews where God commanded death for fornixation and adultery. And even something as simple as kids saying they hate mom
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 22:28:41 IST 2015,@candidateross @FoxNews thank you for proving me right. You have no problem with the OT. WHERE GOD COMMANDED INFANTICIDE. (1 Sam 15:3)
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 22:27:46 IST 2015,@candidateross @FoxNews that is what he does. Word for word. I invite anyone and everyone to read it. Word for word.
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 22:27:05 IST 2015,@candidateross @FoxNews in verses 3-5. Jesus chastises them for making a way to avoid the law to put their offspring to death.
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 22:26:20 IST 2015,@candidateross @FoxNews no. You're wrong. Let me explain your holy book to you since you want to ignore it.
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 22:24:43 IST 2015,@candidateross @FoxNews when it does. Specifically.
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 22:24:32 IST 2015,"@candidateross @FoxNews yea. They are called Christians. All I did was read the book. You're the one insisting it doesn't say ""kill babies"""
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 22:22:15 IST 2015,@candidateross @FoxNews they are being called hypocrites for not putting their kids to death bud. Ignore it all you want. It's there in ink.
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 22:20:39 IST 2015,@candidateross @FoxNews lol. CHRISTianity disagrees. And so does the bible. They are following what it says.
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 22:19:50 IST 2015,@candidateross @FoxNews you don't want to bring the bible into this. I'll show you exactly what's wrong with your God and savior.
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 22:19:12 IST 2015,"@candidateross @FoxNews of infants. Specifically of infants. ""Children and infants"" quite separately."
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 22:18:43 IST 2015,@candidateross @FoxNews Jesus IS God. Or some part of God. That means Jesus bears some blame for 1 Samuel 15:3: where he orders the murder
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 22:18:04 IST 2015,@candidateross @FoxNews what about where Jesus says he and his father are one. They are exact images of one another. Or maybe you believe
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 22:17:11 IST 2015,@candidateross @FoxNews do you think you know better than the apostle Paul? Who taught that any who don't accept Christ will not be saved?
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 22:16:33 IST 2015,@candidateross @FoxNews I don't think I did actually. Did you know at Matt 15:1-9 Jesus chastised the Jews for not killing their offspring?

charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 21:23:44 IST 2015,@Reuters 2016 will be hotter. That's how climate change works. #duh
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 21:20:33 IST 2015,@Reuters I vote we end Christianity and Islam both. They both worship the exact same God who kills babies. #fact
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 21:04:14 IST 2015,@FoxNews @DanaPerino a great education in America? Is that a joke?
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 20:59:36 IST 2015,@Hajjiri @HarryStopes @cozybop neither does Professor Dawkins.
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 20:59:19 IST 2015,@Hajjiri @HarryStopes @cozybop you apparently see a distinction btween skin colors that I do not. Because you think racially. I do not.
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 20:58:23 IST 2015,@Hajjiri @HarryStopes @cozybop you're the one making t about race. Islam is a religion. Not a race. Doesn't matter how many are dark.
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 20:05:28 IST 2015,@Hajjiri @HarryStopes @cozybop no. That's not how racism works. Lol. Ironically. What you just said is racism. All Muslims are dark? Racist.

charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 19:34:37 IST 2015,@HarryStopes @cozybop if you  insist it was racism and Islam should he loved and adored instead of ridiculed. Move to Syria. Keep in touch.
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 19:33:21 IST 2015,@HarryStopes @cozybop I'm pretty sure you started it. By insisting Islam was a race. I replied to that by correcting your misunderstanding.
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 19:27:22 IST 2015,"@HarryStopes @cozybop because even if he was (he's not), it wouldn't have any bearing on his ability to be right about that which he speaks."
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 19:26:29 IST 2015,@HarryStopes @cozybop even if this was true (which it isn't) it wouldn't nullify any of the things he has written or said.
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 19:18:43 IST 2015,@HarryStopes @cozybop again. Islam isn't a race. It's a religion.
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 19:18:21 IST 2015,@HarryStopes @cozybop Islam is not a race. So there's no way it can be racism. #lol
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 19:17:13 IST 2015,@RichardDawkins but you post an article about a real thing that happens and OMG. #sorry #ranting
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 19:16:48 IST 2015,@RichardDawkins nobody got all worked up when the kid got shot just for picking up a rocket launcher in American sniper.
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 19:16:24 IST 2015,"@RichardDawkins how many of them chant ""death to America"" right along with their parents?"
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 19:15:55 IST 2015,@RichardDawkins TBH I'm not sure why anyone finds it so absurd that a Muslim kid is more likely to be a killer and likely not so innocent.
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 19:13:59 IST 2015,@RichardDawkins I got your point. The world is just still way to sensitive about religion. That's the only reason this is happening.
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 19:13:01 IST 2015,@CNN @RichardDawkins by providing evidence Islam makes kids killers. #facts
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 19:11:43 IST 2015,"@CNN @RichardDawkins and especially because he's Muslim is this true. If you disagree, you're just ignoring reality. A reality he showed.."
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 19:11:09 IST 2015,@CNN @RichardDawkins his point is a well made one. He's making the point that just because he's young doesn't mean he's innocent...
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 19:06:10 IST 2015,@NBCNews @alivitali wow
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 18:35:56 IST 2015,@candidateross @FoxNews most hate in the world only exists because it came from some man claiming to speak for God.
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 18:35:33 IST 2015,@candidateross @FoxNews and the hatred of gay people by both Christians and Muslims. Unnatural. Only because of religion.
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 18:35:03 IST 2015,@candidateross @FoxNews do people naturally celebrate the death of their children like Islamists do? I think not.
