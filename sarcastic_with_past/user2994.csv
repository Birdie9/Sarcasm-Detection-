AustinDGates,Tue Jun 16 04:27:13 IST 2015,@SportsCenter damn no way?! If they do that they'll still be able to get knocked out in the 2nd rd. of the playoffs #sarcastic #LakersNation
AustinDGates,Mon Jun 15 19:21:33 IST 2015,"As good as Lebron is playing, he doesn't deserve MVP of the Cavs lose. Curry's having a ""bad series"" and is averaging 26, 5, & 6"
AustinDGates,Wed Jun 10 23:52:59 IST 2015,Dont get it twisted either. I still love me some Kobe! His champion mentality and killer instinct make him a beast of his own #butbronballin
AustinDGates,Wed Jun 10 23:52:10 IST 2015,"As an avid Kobe > LeBron arguer I have to say, there's no more gap. What he's doing in this Finals with this team is the stuff of legend"

AustinDGates,Mon Jun 08 19:48:12 IST 2015,Lebron has the team in the D-up and I'll do the rest psyche and it's been working
AustinDGates,Mon Jun 08 19:40:51 IST 2015,Steph has to step up if they wanna win. You can't let Delly hold you.. You're the MVP!
AustinDGates,Mon Jun 08 19:33:52 IST 2015,Cavs have looked like the better team in both games so far and that's without Kyrie in game 2. Gonna be a better series than I thought!
