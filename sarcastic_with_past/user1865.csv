tarheelblog,Mon Feb 29 01:18:39 IST 2016,Poor Chase Jeter.

tarheelblog,Mon Feb 29 01:15:39 IST 2016,Pitt had about 10 offensive rebounds on that one possession.
tarheelblog,Mon Feb 29 01:11:43 IST 2016,Oh hey I saw this Pitt team last season.
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 19:25:08 IST 2016,Thing that gets me on the Curry shot is it wasnâ€™t a heave. He pulled up and shot from 38 feet like it was normal

tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 10:06:34 IST 2016,@Sam_Rardin Yes but I didn't want any part of that in the Final Four.
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 10:04:26 IST 2016,Came close to UNC playing Curry & Davidson in the 2008 Final Four. It was Kansas instead & that's all I have to say about that
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 10:03:09 IST 2016,Here is the game. Davidson won by 30. https://t.co/yoY6wyR7K4
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 10:00:54 IST 2016,"When Curry was at Davidson, one team decided to double team him the whole game."
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 10:00:08 IST 2016,"@RellDMC We joke about guys being ""in range"" when they walk in the building. That's true of him. It's nuts."
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 09:58:10 IST 2016,@RellDMC It's unreal. His range is anything starting at half court.
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 09:55:57 IST 2016,Oh 32 feet. Wow.
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 09:55:40 IST 2016,35 feet. He shot it like it was nothing.
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 09:54:46 IST 2016,HOLY CRAP
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 09:43:58 IST 2016,I just...
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 09:26:22 IST 2016,Steph Curry has all the cheat codes. All of them.
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 09:21:59 IST 2016,I totally forgot Billy Donovan coaches OKC.
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 09:15:02 IST 2016,@JeffFischel Campaign mangers calling timeouts except for the candidate I like he probably wouldn't call one.

tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 07:17:14 IST 2016,@joeovies @_andrewcarter SID sits with him on the dais
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 07:16:28 IST 2016,@derickjthomas So what should UNC have changed defensively?
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 07:08:36 IST 2016,@joeovies @Strohsahl @Joey_Powell And that is an issue considering the other number.
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 07:06:17 IST 2016,Five of them on the road. One at the buzzer.  https://t.co/Z2Weep2xgG
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 06:55:12 IST 2016,Come on
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 06:47:09 IST 2016,FGM: UNC 25 UVa 26. 3PM: Both teams with 7. FTM: UVa 12 UNC 7. Cavs are 12-12 at the line. UNC 7-10.
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 06:45:00 IST 2016,How is that not a foul?
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 06:43:41 IST 2016,@Peyton_Cook13 I don't know. Guess he pushed off?
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 06:39:41 IST 2016,@tzee9 Nope. Not buying that.
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 06:38:54 IST 2016,Can't give that up.
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 06:32:50 IST 2016,@RSL222 See next tweet.
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 06:32:35 IST 2016,@MCase2 According to the refs UNC is being physical every time down the floor.
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 06:32:07 IST 2016,And to be clear. UVa is also hitting shots and the ones they miss they've grabbed offensive rebounds.
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 06:31:00 IST 2016,Going to take UNC stringing together a few stops and don't think that's happening with the way this game is being called.
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 06:28:10 IST 2016,UNC forces two misses then can't grab the ORB. UVa scores off both.
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 06:24:24 IST 2016,UNC really needed that. So did Paige
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 06:19:13 IST 2016,Feels like Berry never gets calls when he takes it to the basket.
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 06:15:28 IST 2016,Ball was off the rim.
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 06:10:39 IST 2016,Officiating evening up. UVa had four fouls in the first half. Already called for three this half.
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 06:08:06 IST 2016,"@brettlive Oh this is your first experience with this. Yeah, they whine about EVERYTHING"
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 06:01:32 IST 2016,UVa doesn't rebound on the offensive end opting to get back on defense but  were efficient with the ones they did get.
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 06:00:48 IST 2016,"UNC had a DRB% of 82.4. Gave up three offensive rebounds, UVa converted two of those to points."
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 05:57:02 IST 2016,"@tzee9 Not really, some of those have been ridiculous stuff. Couple of teams shot well behind the 3 point line and hit it."
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 05:55:09 IST 2016,@TheJ_A_C Notre Dame
tarheelblog,Sun Feb 28 05:52:58 IST 2016,"Opposing teams now 10-14 FG, 7-10 3P & 4-4 FT with six seconds or left in the first half vs UNC."
