Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 14:43:02 IST 2016,I find it funny when feminists bitch and moan about media not passing the Bechdel test.

Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 13:13:17 IST 2016,@andrewgleason Don't have the patience of reading more than the introduction...
Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 12:58:43 IST 2016,@andrewgleason Although I can't blame them too much... there have been some very rotten eggs in the SJW basket.
Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 12:58:00 IST 2016,"@andrewgleason Yeah, ppl have been a little too enthusiastically trying to interpret ""liking kids"" as something bad."
Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 04:14:11 IST 2016,"@Alyx_t1fm @dhmapplethorpe As far as I'm concerned, everyone is guilty of retardism until proven innocent."
Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 04:13:54 IST 2016,"@dhmapplethorpe >I'm not retarded
I am not yet convinced of this claim."
Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 04:10:36 IST 2016,@transyewest Have no idea... looks cool. Let me know if you find out.

Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 03:50:27 IST 2016,@TheCartoonLoon I forgot you're using misogynistic technology.... I guess you can try on the tablet ....
Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 03:48:34 IST 2016,@MargaretsBelly I think they filtered what gifs show up. Try searching feminism and finding a gif making fun of it.

Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 03:36:44 IST 2016,"@Femikrit @NorBdelta Sooo... how about you apologize first, you cisgendered shitlord."
Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 03:35:48 IST 2016,"@Femikrit @NorBdelta The only reason I can think of that you assumed that, is b/c you also assumed I was male."
Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 03:35:41 IST 2016,"@Femikrit @NorBdelta Thing is, in my original tweet, I used no pronouns at all. You were the one that assumed, that I assumed it was a woman"
Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 03:28:55 IST 2016,@Femikrit @NorBdelta I will apologize with my dick in her ass.
Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 03:25:59 IST 2016,@TheCartoonLoon Just splash some blood on there and call it feminist art.

Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 03:15:56 IST 2016,"@_punchmonster @transyewest JAPAN

YES"
Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 03:10:07 IST 2016,"@transyewest @B00T5TR4P No warm water, or even no running water at all. I've had it all."
Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 03:09:51 IST 2016,"@transyewest @B00T5TR4P I joke, but I would lie if I said I never was in your situation before. Lousy or no heat."
Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 03:06:59 IST 2016,@transyewest @B00T5TR4P Well someone gets easily upset when she's cold... :P
Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 03:04:37 IST 2016,"@B00T5TR4P @transyewest It help a little if you're desperate, but it's dangerous b/c it could use up all the oxygen."
Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 03:03:52 IST 2016,@B00T5TR4P @transyewest Got another idea. Might not be a very good one. Turn up the stove to max. Just don't let it burn through the night
Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 03:00:48 IST 2016,@GummyGumShoe No.... breaking it into panels would actually have been hard work. I mean imagine having to DRAW a comic! Preposterous!
Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 02:57:38 IST 2016,@GummyGumShoe @VeyGraphics is this like work in progress or something?
Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 02:55:36 IST 2016,@B00T5TR4P @transyewest I think he left some time ago. And I don't think her small dog is enough to do the job.
Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 02:52:40 IST 2016,"@B00T5TR4P @transyewest In all seriousness, we need to brainstorm some way to warm up this tranny's ass."
Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 02:44:18 IST 2016,@B00T5TR4P @transyewest It doesn't help if the warmth stays in the PC case.
Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 02:43:24 IST 2016,@B00T5TR4P @transyewest Actually you would want a decent fan speed to spread any heat generated in the entire room.
Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 02:41:29 IST 2016,@B00T5TR4P @transyewest Had a similar situation back in my dorm room days... Tried pushing my PC to warm up. It didn't made any difference.
Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 02:38:28 IST 2016,@transyewest Time for some overclocking....
Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 02:25:17 IST 2016,"@transyewest Shh.. not now. I'm taking my hot, relaxing bath...."
Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 02:22:31 IST 2016,"@transyewest We'll, I'm probably going to hell for laughing right now."
Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 02:21:11 IST 2016,@transyewest ??? Don't tell me you live in Manchester
Alyx_t1fm,Thu Feb 25 02:15:47 IST 2016,"@transyewest Will come to kill you, but I need to take a bath first. You'll have to wait a while."
