jrobertsnow,Mon Feb 29 08:03:04 IST 2016,I love that Jennifer Garner introduced that Mad Max package. I'd pay a lot to see her try a post-apocalyptic film #sarcasm #Oscars

jrobertsnow,Mon Feb 29 07:07:25 IST 2016,Loving this monologue so far. Finally some sensible rhetoric. #Oscars
jrobertsnow,Fri Feb 26 03:35:07 IST 2016,@Henderburn His take is pretty exaggerated. There's more depth in Birdman than he thinks. I liked Revenant just a bit less.

jrobertsnow,Fri Feb 19 21:20:23 IST 2016,@aeon456 I'm curious if there's rationale for livestreaming his projects. Allows the ability to remotely drop in and out of the experience?
jrobertsnow,Fri Feb 19 21:09:27 IST 2016,@aeon456 He's full of contradictions. You may be right about him being kindhearted...I've often thought his trajectory resembles Downey Jr's
jrobertsnow,Fri Feb 19 21:02:40 IST 2016,@aeon456 Maybe! It's certainly less obtuse than apologies in skywriting or a paper bag on his head at a red carpet.
