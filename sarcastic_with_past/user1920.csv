DisCounselor,Sat Feb 27 00:52:41 IST 2016,@DrunkAtdisney I'll me more excited about an overhaul of Epcot than Star Wars Land.
DisCounselor,Sat Feb 27 00:51:29 IST 2016,@DrunkAtdisney We have to endure the tombstones there for another 11 years? It's like the graveyard of all Walt's broken dreams over EPCOT.

DisCounselor,Thu Feb 25 23:47:27 IST 2016,@DrunkAtdisney I imagine something exotic & multicultural yet progressive to fit with EPCOT. And possibly home to a new Adventurers Club.

DisCounselor,Wed Feb 24 06:14:19 IST 2016,@disneyislifee the hat was only put up because Disney lost the rights to use the theater for promotion
DisCounselor,Wed Feb 24 06:12:43 IST 2016,"@disneyislifee Nothing, you could see the theater, that was the point."
DisCounselor,Wed Feb 24 06:10:35 IST 2016,"@disneyislifee If you visited MGM Studios before the hat you wouldn't say hat. I didn't hate the hat, I liked it but it didn't belong there."
