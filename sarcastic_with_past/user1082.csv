Beckpaulson,Wed Dec 30 11:15:19 IST 2015,@HelmanDC Too bad he doesn't have a lot of help.  Especially defense.
Beckpaulson,Wed Dec 30 10:56:16 IST 2015,@ToksOlagundoye I usually try to fly Southwest everytime I fly.  Everyone is treated the same and it is so much cheaper.

Beckpaulson,Thu Dec 17 07:55:59 IST 2015,@Julie_Boudwin Better safe than sorry.  I think she stopped herself before it became something bad.
Beckpaulson,Thu Dec 17 01:53:48 IST 2015,Here is another bad parking note. @NathanFillion https://t.co/UtkR8DUdV8
Beckpaulson,Mon Dec 14 05:08:10 IST 2015,@ESPNNFL He has not been good this whole year.  Not worth the $$
Beckpaulson,Fri Dec 11 09:56:55 IST 2015,@ksorbs The O-line is just plain terrible

Beckpaulson,Tue Dec 08 07:53:09 IST 2015,@HelmanDC Hopefully he isn't hurt too bad.
Beckpaulson,Tue Dec 08 07:51:47 IST 2015,OMG.  The offensive line sucks.  #CowboysNation #DALvsWAS
Beckpaulson,Tue Dec 08 07:44:28 IST 2015,@DylanTheMan37 Imagine that.
Beckpaulson,Tue Dec 08 07:39:21 IST 2015,@HelmanDC I was just saying the same thing.
Beckpaulson,Tue Dec 08 07:38:10 IST 2015,What is Cassel's problem tonight?  He hasn't been that bad before.  #CowboysNation
Beckpaulson,Tue Dec 08 07:29:25 IST 2015,@BklynSquint so precious
Beckpaulson,Tue Dec 08 07:28:05 IST 2015,Why don't we play the punting game.  #DALvsWAS
Beckpaulson,Tue Dec 08 07:23:59 IST 2015,@DylanTheMan37 Man they need a new O line.  They are killing the team right now.

Beckpaulson,Wed Dec 02 08:02:56 IST 2015,I don't know what it is but I can't help but watch #Castle on #TNT.
Beckpaulson,Tue Dec 01 10:18:26 IST 2015,The shock and awe of both coaches faces.  Definite shock factor.  @MNFenESPN
