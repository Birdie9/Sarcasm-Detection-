CorbanMonger,Sun Feb 28 18:20:28 IST 2016,Click and hold on a dock icon to Expose only that app has been removed and replaced with... the right click contextual menu. How useless.
CorbanMonger,Sun Feb 28 18:17:15 IST 2016,"Mission Control is a disaster. It's better in El Capitan than in Lion, etc. but still not as good as Expose and Spaces in Snow Leopard."
CorbanMonger,Sun Feb 28 16:08:23 IST 2016,Spaces doesn't work right in El Capitan. I don't like having the background and menu bar whoosh by. It makes me dizzy. I may abandon Spaces.
CorbanMonger,Sat Feb 27 17:55:36 IST 2016,I will admit that the stoplight colors in Mac OS X El Capitan aren't as offensive as I had anticipated. But my God that finder icon is fugly
CorbanMonger,Sat Feb 27 17:40:50 IST 2016,Finally installed Mac OS X El Capitan. Coming from Snow Leopard is CULTURE SHOCK. Icons look like half baked graphix from a Linux distro.

CorbanMonger,Tue Feb 16 10:57:18 IST 2016,I love the AppleScript Editor. The tools I have to do things so simply and quickly amazes me.

CorbanMonger,Sun Feb 14 10:18:08 IST 2016,The rapidly declining quality of UI and UX design in software concerns me greatly.
CorbanMonger,Fri Feb 12 15:25:48 IST 2016,@SpotifyCares I'm on my home network. No dice. Restarted routers and switches: no effect. Is there a log file the client generates?
CorbanMonger,Fri Feb 12 14:21:23 IST 2016,"@SpotifyCares So, search is broken again. 0 results for every string. Tried reinstalling and relogging. No change. It must be a server issue"
CorbanMonger,Tue Feb 09 19:05:02 IST 2016,@SpotifyCares Works now. Relogged and restarted the app over a dozen times. Just started working. Server issue?
CorbanMonger,Tue Feb 09 18:23:54 IST 2016,"@SpotifyCares reinstalled, first search worked. But, all subsequent searches failed. Relogged in, first search works, all others fail."

CorbanMonger,Wed Feb 03 17:59:16 IST 2016,The new retweet color makes me want to vomit.
CorbanMonger,Tue Feb 02 11:41:50 IST 2016,@CorKoomen Which is why I'm also upset at Apple. They need to support the software their user base still uses. That or offer a better OS.
CorbanMonger,Mon Feb 01 20:07:06 IST 2016,@CorKoomen I couldn't care less about XP or Vista. I'm upset that they are ending support for Mac OS 10.6 Snow Leopard. It's not that old.
CorbanMonger,Mon Feb 01 18:48:48 IST 2016,And now I find out Google will no longer be supporting Chrome updates for Snow Leopard. Yet they are just now ending support for XP. WTF.

CorbanMonger,Wed Dec 23 08:39:45 IST 2015,John Williams outdid himself once again with the Star Wars The Force Awakens score. Rey's Theme is wonderful.
CorbanMonger,Wed Dec 23 06:00:42 IST 2015,Glad I'm not the only one who thinks Rey was written as a Mary Sue in The Force Awakens. Character is conveniently too good at everything.
