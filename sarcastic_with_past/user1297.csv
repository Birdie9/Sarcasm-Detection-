C_THRILLER,Wed Dec 09 21:44:29 IST 2015,Homer goes to College is one of my favorite episodes of The Simpsons. It'd be sweet if @ConanOBrien came back and wrote just one more. #best
C_THRILLER,Wed Dec 09 00:01:40 IST 2015,@hashitan I most def prefer the original. That's probably why Prince didn't want it shown. haha
C_THRILLER,Wed Dec 09 00:00:32 IST 2015,@hashitan Ah. That's why you wrote „Åü„Åæ„Çâ„Çì. I thought it might have a double meaning like „É§„Éê„ÅÑ. That's a hard song to cover well for sure.
C_THRILLER,Tue Dec 08 23:49:30 IST 2015,"@hashitan Watched it. Very cool. I'm not really a Prince fan, but that guy can play guitar and perform."
C_THRILLER,Mon Dec 07 02:56:28 IST 2015,I'm tired and I want to go to sleep. But I'm scared of nightmares so I'm stalling. They just keep getting worse and worse me thinks.

C_THRILLER,Mon Dec 07 01:59:31 IST 2015,"Why are people so hesitant to pass on something that should be loved by all? For shit sakes, I'm his brother! #goodtortillas"
C_THRILLER,Mon Dec 07 01:57:50 IST 2015,I remember asking my brother in law how to make tortillas and he was quite vague. He learned it from some granny in Mexico. #delicious
C_THRILLER,Mon Dec 07 01:48:12 IST 2015,Fuck all the haters out there. Don't try to give me your bullshit. Assholes.

C_THRILLER,Fri Dec 04 20:40:09 IST 2015,Scott Weiland's passing has really hit hard. I can't imagine my life without his music. It's so sad. #RestInPeace https://t.co/OS4xBHPp12

C_THRILLER,Tue Dec 01 23:35:15 IST 2015,"@hashitan It looks so fake and its promoted like, ""just do this and you're life will be better!"""
C_THRILLER,Tue Dec 01 23:32:25 IST 2015,"@hashitan SSN number means nothing. And MN is a cheap imitation. As you know, I live in Japan. And and I see MN on tv a lot."
C_THRILLER,Tue Dec 01 23:17:16 IST 2015,"@hashitan I'm sorry. My Japanese sucks.Are you for mynumber, or not?"
C_THRILLER,Tue Dec 01 23:08:11 IST 2015,"@hashitan I think mynumber is complete bullshit. I thought about the social security number, and realized it's also pointless."
C_THRILLER,Tue Dec 01 22:57:37 IST 2015,Am I that much of an asshole for not caring about something that means so much to someone else? I still respect it. Isn't that enough?
C_THRILLER,Tue Dec 01 22:00:41 IST 2015,I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw this here in rural Japan. It was nostalgic and a bit eerie at the same time. https://t.co/fOOtp3cbhY

C_THRILLER,Mon Nov 30 22:17:33 IST 2015,Why do things that I don't give a shit about just keep getting bigger and bigger?
C_THRILLER,Mon Nov 30 21:54:43 IST 2015,"Who would've known that I would've found a connection with my 21 year old nephew. By the way, I'm 33. We were both raised Mormon. Not now;)"
C_THRILLER,Mon Nov 30 21:06:33 IST 2015,@SimpsonsQOTD Please give me another chance. I promise I'll behave.
C_THRILLER,Mon Nov 30 20:00:50 IST 2015,"So I started it up to make them happy, and now they are like, ""aight"". My god how annoying that is. #damnedifyoudodamnedifyoudont"

C_THRILLER,Sun Nov 29 21:13:14 IST 2015,"@franhealy For starters, I gave up on the radio a long time ago. I guess that's a bit sad isn't it. Hot bath Japanese style with dim lights."

C_THRILLER,Sat Nov 28 20:45:55 IST 2015,@franhealy Yep. Attracted because we'd like to sit in it. Repelled because some parents might solely rely on this to entertain their kids.
