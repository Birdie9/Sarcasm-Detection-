THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 12:35:44 IST 2016,@omarcanuck if the canucks management looked at possession stats we wouldn't still have sbisa/bartkowski/etc.

THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 11:34:09 IST 2016,"@Primlar john tortorella was also an aquilini pick for coach (though i still think the canucks were pretty decent that year, just unlucky)"
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 11:33:35 IST 2016,"@Primlar for example, after losing in 2011 the aquilinis pushed gillis to build more like the team that beat him"
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 11:32:50 IST 2016,@Primlar i can only hope it's soon but linden has a ton of trust in him for some reason and ownership hasn't been all that great either
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 11:29:57 IST 2016,"@Primlar benning's been GM for not even two full seasons and there's a huge list of really stupid mistakes he's made

that's absurd"
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 11:29:09 IST 2016,@Primlar worst trade they've made but they've made a ton of dumb signings or waiver claims or minor league assignments
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 11:28:15 IST 2016,"@Primlar problem with vancouver is that this isn't the only time they've screwed up really badly, nor is it the most egregious"

THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 11:20:00 IST 2016,"@Primlar don't worry, i know you weren't

doesn't make the deal any less stupid, god i hate the canucks management group"
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 10:44:49 IST 2016,@gzordtron @Yellowbuizel i still don't see what's so bad about it compared to other localizations
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 10:37:02 IST 2016,"@gzordtron @Yellowbuizel regardless of the reason, it was gonna happen and someone was gonna complain

just chill"
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 10:36:37 IST 2016,"@gzordtron @Yellowbuizel a secret: almost every game from japan that gets localized loses something in translation

Fates is no different"
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 10:33:54 IST 2016,"@gzordtron @Yellowbuizel as for dialogue being cut, that also happens a lot? i don't see the issue"
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 10:33:34 IST 2016,"@gzordtron @Yellowbuizel a lot of nintendo games have dialogue like that, first one that comes to mind is pokemon diamond/pearl"
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 10:26:56 IST 2016,"@gzordtron @Yellowbuizel what about the game is so different aside from that
is it the soleil thing? because some changes are for the better"

THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 09:22:30 IST 2016,"@watsukoguy @qdsworld asset management as a whole hasn't been good, nor has his ability to gauge value

trades/FAs just an extension of that"

i just don't have hope"

i can only hope the Lindenning era doesn't last much longer"

either way, i wish shink the best"
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 09:05:35 IST 2016,"@watsukoguy @qdsworld if he prospers, maybe the regime will notice they made a mistake and not make that same mistake in the future"
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 09:00:07 IST 2016,"@watsukoguy @qdsworld it's less like ""yes this is something i truly want"" and more like i want the regime's bad decisions to bite them hard"
