shannontatlock,Thu Feb 25 05:22:30 IST 2016,Just love having my time wasted by inconsiderate people. It's seriously one of my favourite pastimes. #sarcasm
shannontatlock,Thu Feb 25 05:21:42 IST 2016,@Bandit132 I've never been before! Looking forward to game on Saturday night. My husband's first NHL game! We'll be blue in a sea of red! :)

shannontatlock,Tue Feb 23 09:01:34 IST 2016,"Love seeing all the @DynastyCurling gear all over at #STOH2016! @C_hodgy has done a good job, making it the clothing of the #curling world!"
shannontatlock,Tue Feb 23 08:51:40 IST 2016,"What the heck is throwing ""down easy""? I guess by using that to communicate weight, you throw off the other team. #codewords #STOH2016"
shannontatlock,Tue Feb 23 08:26:07 IST 2016,@cathstuart2 @DAVIDsTEA I had it in store on ice and then came home and made it hot. SO delicious and best part! Guilt free!

shannontatlock,Tue Feb 23 07:58:42 IST 2016,Love it when it works out that you can flip from one #stoh2016 game to the other on @TSNCurling & avoid commercials! #itsthesimplethings
shannontatlock,Tue Feb 23 07:41:51 IST 2016,RT @JockCartier: It's scary setting your PVR to record the Scotties... nothing worse than coming home to 3 hours of Jennifer Jones #STOH2016
