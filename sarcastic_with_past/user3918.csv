Afraid of legit criticisms are you Anita?"
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:42:41 IST 2015,@Polygon @femfreq She knows by cancelling her speech it showed that a few  people can scare her out of anything
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:42:00 IST 2015,@Polygon @femfreq But Anita saw it was more profitable to cancel the speech to make people feel sorry for her generating more sympathy.
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:41:11 IST 2015,@Polygon @femfreq and they came back and said there was no real or credible threats to either the speaker being Anita or students attending
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:39:58 IST 2015,@Polygon @femfreq and the officials came back after investigating the claims and saying there was no credible or plausible threats
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:39:21 IST 2015,@Polygon @femfreq Example: When Anita cancelled her speech at the one university because some dumb idiot threatened a school shooting
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:38:31 IST 2015,@Polygon @femfreq threats made against Anita are empty and have to backbone behind them
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:38:11 IST 2015,"@Polygon @femfreq One last thing, the things @femfreq seems to ignore is that law enforcement officials have said the majority of the"
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:37:21 IST 2015,"@Polygon @femfreq because then the people doing the alleged harassment will go underground, hide everything and wait for the smoke to clear"
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:36:30 IST 2015,@Polygon @femfreq recommend. They say just give us the info and then keep quiet about it otherwise it will make their investigation harder
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:35:45 IST 2015,@Polygon @femfreq and publicize the threats and get people to feel sorry for her despite what law enforcement officals even the FBI
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:35:02 IST 2015,@Polygon @femfreq them take care of it but no she had to jump on the opportunity and ride the SJW Knight warrior bandwagon
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:33:58 IST 2015,@Polygon @femfreq to continue on with what they do. All anita ever had to do was just send everything to the proper agencies and then let
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:33:27 IST 2015,@Polygon @femfreq and then don't publicize the threats pubicly because then you are just sort of inviting copycats as well as inviting them
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:32:47 IST 2015,"@Polygon @femfreq  Here is something interesting law enforcement officials say if you are harassed online, just send the info to them"
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:31:52 IST 2015,@Polygon @femfreq with people like Anita just for having a different viewpoint then her.
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:31:23 IST 2015,"@Polygon @femfreq It is just like the game Social Justice Warrior, it is completely one sided and was used to mock gamers who disagree"
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:30:41 IST 2015,"@Polygon @femfreq I bet we all know who consulted on that game, right @femfreq"
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:29:51 IST 2015,@broadbent @femfreq Just saying you don't understand the meaning of the word slander You say slander when people legitimately criticize you
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:28:43 IST 2015,"@broadbent @femfreq and even when you sort of allow any amount of criticism you just say ""oh help me they are slandering me"""
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:28:00 IST 2015,@broadbent @femfreq and also are only used to people agreeing with you and you never let people truly challenge you
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:27:30 IST 2015,"@broadbent @femfreq which is something you are not used to, you are used to just reading off of a script you rehearse rather well"
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:26:53 IST 2015,"@broadbent @femfreq You really don't understand the meaning of the word slander Anita, you say slander because you have been critcized"
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:25:46 IST 2015,@femfreq What is your problem with even letting people hit the dislike button on a youtube video to show their disapproval.
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:25:10 IST 2015,@femfreq you are afraid of even people clicking the dislike button to show their disposal of your work.
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:24:48 IST 2015,"@femfreq because on all your videos you remove comments which could be debated on both sides, but you also disable ratings which shows"
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:24:07 IST 2015,@femfreq about is having only people that agree with you and you will censor anybody that disagrees with you. I think that is fair to say
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:23:34 IST 2015,"@femfreq you are also quoted as saying ""Comment sections should be heavily moderated and shut off without apology"" That shows all you care"
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:22:52 IST 2015,@femfreq heck you don't even know the meaning of what it means to be a true feminist
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:22:22 IST 2015,@femfreq how insensitive you are to the whole situation and shows you know nothing of what you talk about. Heck you don't know what the
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:21:48 IST 2015,"@femfreq Also your tweets back when the Seattle Washington shooting occurred and you blamed the incident on ""Toxic Masculinity"" show just"
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:20:53 IST 2015,@femfreq because the main character cared for her as a person. But of course you wouldn't know that because you didn't do your reasearch
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:20:20 IST 2015,@femfreq but rather with the development of the relationship he cared for her and was willing to do anything for her including rescuing her
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:19:45 IST 2015,@femfreq also the thing where the girl was captured and the main character goes to rescue her was not because she was an object in mans game
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:19:06 IST 2015,"@femfreq In dying light in the beginning, you are almost dead and the girl in the game saves you"
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:18:40 IST 2015,@femfreq Example your comments about dying light saying it has a damsel in distress story line are one example you did not research the game
Kotorfan1313,Fri Apr 03 00:17:58 IST 2015,"@femfreq Those tweets are not fake you are only saying this because you were caught red handed about being wrong, you do realize that"
Kotorfan1313,Sat Mar 28 00:08:39 IST 2015,@druifordare @femfreq choose a real feminist like Gloria Steinem or Emma Watson
Kotorfan1313,Sat Mar 28 00:08:04 IST 2015,"@druifordare @femfreq That was a mistake, you should have chosen someone more reputable and not someone who doesn't exagerate facts."
Kotorfan1313,Sat Mar 28 00:05:56 IST 2015,"@femfreq No body is afraid of it, what we don't like is someone who blatantly lies and eggagerte facts to serve their own personal needs."
Kotorfan1313,Sat Mar 28 00:05:04 IST 2015,@femfreq what empowers them and you have no right to tell them how to act. Frankly it appalls me that you even think that.
Kotorfan1313,Sat Mar 28 00:03:18 IST 2015,"@femfreq You mean a video of how you think you have the right to tell women how to act, no mam you do not, females have the right to choose"
Kotorfan1313,Sat Mar 28 00:00:43 IST 2015,@femfreq @TIME and that was a huge mistake they should have named you the biggest con artist and lair of the year
Kotorfan1313,Sun Mar 22 18:32:32 IST 2015,@AstroKatie @femfreq in video games. You are a big hypocrite.
Kotorfan1313,Sun Mar 22 18:32:15 IST 2015,@AstroKatie @femfreq but of course you don't notice that because they aren't video games and you mist put an end to the so called sexism.
Kotorfan1313,Sun Mar 22 18:31:20 IST 2015,@AstroKatie @femfreq also you do know @josswhedon uses the same so called tropes in his movies that you critcize
Kotorfan1313,Sun Mar 22 18:30:43 IST 2015,@AstroKatie @femfreq is it because Jack Thompson was a man? You have no crediiblity
Kotorfan1313,Sun Mar 22 18:30:12 IST 2015,@AstroKatie @femfreq equal to yours if not greater. So why do you defend yourself and not someone like him when he received death threats
Kotorfan1313,Sun Mar 22 18:29:05 IST 2015,@AstroKatie @femfreq after you recieve death thrteas and yet when Jack Thompson criticized video games for violence hereceived death threats
Kotorfan1313,Sun Mar 22 18:28:19 IST 2015,@AstroKatie @femfreq You know what Anita do you know what is interesting you have all these supporters that come to your defense
