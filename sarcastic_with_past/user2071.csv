Nvrgvup15,Fri Feb 26 00:46:48 IST 2016,@TurtleDeLoach27 @SkipPrince should ut have an enforced curfew at 9:00pm since it's not safe at night? #lockdown #lightsout

Nvrgvup15,Thu Feb 25 21:35:52 IST 2016,@country_cookin OU and Mizzou both happy the ut fiasco is keeping their stuff in the back pages.
Nvrgvup15,Thu Feb 25 05:43:22 IST 2016,@SkipPrince he's watching Deadpool according to his Twitter. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Nvrgvup15,Thu Feb 25 04:22:31 IST 2016,@NashVegas69 What about the kid he supposedly punched at a practice? Does that kid talk now? Wasn't that Crowder who just got child porn?
Nvrgvup15,Thu Feb 25 00:34:16 IST 2016,@SAWdesigns You work at home. Turn up the thermostat. #DontBeCheap #InHoc
Nvrgvup15,Wed Feb 24 21:18:15 IST 2016,"@NashVegas69 ""recruiting"" has to be high on the list."
Nvrgvup15,Wed Feb 24 20:44:13 IST 2016,I have an extra for Saturday's game vs uk. $60 for Vandy fans. Section 3F. Will meet at game by will call.
Nvrgvup15,Wed Feb 24 20:41:57 IST 2016,@AuGoldfinger @GottliebShow Please don't discuss the baseline benches. Everyone already knows where they are located. #befresh
Nvrgvup15,Wed Feb 24 09:27:52 IST 2016,@AuGoldfinger 1st is fans on right with hands up in disbelief after MFD  block. 2nd is fans on left with hands up after Hendo made 3.
Nvrgvup15,Wed Feb 24 08:04:53 IST 2016,@SkipPrince not at all but he's a freshman. Getting some slack.
Nvrgvup15,Wed Feb 24 08:01:37 IST 2016,@SkipPrince The total collapse of Riley and Cressler has been a major factor this season. Need some help at guard position.
Nvrgvup15,Wed Feb 24 07:52:34 IST 2016,@angi_walker NashVegas and a few others on him.
Nvrgvup15,Wed Feb 24 07:51:18 IST 2016,@SkipPrince don't forget Riley made a 3 also. ðŸ˜³
Nvrgvup15,Wed Feb 24 07:48:07 IST 2016,RT @dbc5361: Watch Josh Henderson steal a bite of popcorn from Florida fans after hitting an 85 foot shot. https://t.co/fbtAcH1G6Y
Nvrgvup15,Wed Feb 24 07:47:59 IST 2016,@dbc5361 that's awesome!!!!
Nvrgvup15,Wed Feb 24 07:45:17 IST 2016,RT @TrainIsland: Want to hear @joefishervu call Josh Henderson's buzzer-beating full court heave? Here you go: https://t.co/mdXJVIi9wt
Nvrgvup15,Wed Feb 24 07:36:25 IST 2016,@NashSportsRadio @The_Fourth_Wade Just so happens he had the same number of W's. Nice game WB4.
Nvrgvup15,Wed Feb 24 07:16:48 IST 2016,I've heard announcers laughing a lot at refs this year. I'm glad they can. SEC fans are frustrated.
Nvrgvup15,Wed Feb 24 06:26:06 IST 2016,Josh shooting better from 3 than Riley.
Nvrgvup15,Wed Feb 24 06:15:22 IST 2016,Goal tending
Nvrgvup15,Wed Feb 24 06:02:14 IST 2016,@vandy_62 you type faster than me. My question exactly.
Nvrgvup15,Wed Feb 24 00:12:42 IST 2016,@dbc5361 Are the guys on either side of him embarrassed to be seated beside him or sleeping?
Nvrgvup15,Tue Feb 23 22:58:21 IST 2016,"I haven't seen the PC but out of all the media, Twitter, etc., the only ones I see defending it are ut fans and their media relation dept."
Nvrgvup15,Tue Feb 23 21:27:33 IST 2016,@NashVegas69 Because their sched couldn't be cleared. Other things more important that abuse/rape allegations.
Nvrgvup15,Tue Feb 23 21:21:21 IST 2016,"@NashVegas69 So the reason they are losing is  not the facilities, she just can't coach."
Nvrgvup15,Tue Feb 23 21:03:42 IST 2016,"By the sounds of things, the ut baseball/softball teams should be really good. Everyone got to take swings at softball lobbed questions."
Nvrgvup15,Tue Feb 23 21:01:53 IST 2016,@NashVegas69 probably has strep throat or the flu.
Nvrgvup15,Tue Feb 23 20:53:22 IST 2016,"@NashVegas69 Exactly what they are thinking. Their next one will be ""I want to thank ut for the opportunity....."""
Nvrgvup15,Tue Feb 23 20:39:42 IST 2016,"@NashVegas69 Why wait? Same script, diff day. #copy/paste"
Nvrgvup15,Mon Feb 22 09:17:50 IST 2016,@NashVegas69 what is it about today? My friends in Clarksville saw this guy all over town. #PutSomeClothesOnPeople https://t.co/Iu6DAzIi9B

Nvrgvup15,Fri Feb 19 01:11:27 IST 2016,@mopatton_sports @NashVegas69 I guess they do t have enough time to discuss both in 3hrs.
Nvrgvup15,Fri Feb 19 00:13:20 IST 2016,@NashVegas69 giving their listeners options to not discuss it. #EasyWayOut https://t.co/uQ8hX05sqX
Nvrgvup15,Thu Feb 18 22:55:30 IST 2016,@dbc5361 At least CKS was man vs man and not a woman beater.
Nvrgvup15,Thu Feb 18 03:00:38 IST 2016,What I think/hope is most telling of VCDW is his silence this entire season.The fans want better and he has to have heard them at some point
Nvrgvup15,Thu Feb 18 02:17:11 IST 2016,"@AdamSparks If truly based on attendance and not sales,CKS will be gone.I am season tix holder for many years and this is worst in a while"
Nvrgvup15,Thu Feb 18 01:16:11 IST 2016,"@dbc5361 may be a shot at IV but I believe IV wants more fire out of this team and can't get it, esp DJ. Competitiveness getting best of him"
Nvrgvup15,Wed Feb 17 22:32:42 IST 2016,@dbc5361 will be lots of burst bubbles this year the way CBB is going. You better be conf champ or too 25 to feel good.
Nvrgvup15,Wed Feb 17 21:44:49 IST 2016,My thoughts: CKS is good @ x&o's. Coaches smaller teams great that can run Princeton style. Seems lost with trad big man inside/out game.
Nvrgvup15,Wed Feb 17 21:32:57 IST 2016,@HMDSportsBlogVU 1st ever SEC team to be a 16 seed?
Nvrgvup15,Wed Feb 17 20:42:45 IST 2016,@dbc5361 Not working so well for them. May need to change their speaker/agenda  topics.
Nvrgvup15,Wed Feb 17 20:39:41 IST 2016,@dbc5361 Looks to be true.  https://t.co/Sow4G3QOlM
Nvrgvup15,Wed Feb 17 09:27:37 IST 2016,Of course. Why not.
Nvrgvup15,Wed Feb 17 09:22:27 IST 2016,Call the over the back foul and no reason for the monitor.
