wyeager,Sun Feb 28 03:27:09 IST 2016,Sec officials confused?  No. Not them. #sarcasm #bbn @gobigblue #UKvsVandy
wyeager,Sun Feb 28 03:16:43 IST 2016,Murray is killing them. #bbn #GoBigBlue #UKvsVandy
wyeager,Sun Feb 28 03:13:21 IST 2016,@blphelps12 Murray makes up for that. But cats don't rb as well without Willis
wyeager,Sun Feb 28 03:04:35 IST 2016,To quote @jeremytackett must. Hit. Free. Throws. #bbn #GoBigBlue #UKvsVandy
wyeager,Sun Feb 28 02:58:49 IST 2016,Really missing Willis and his rebounding. #bbn #gobigblue #UKvsVandy
wyeager,Sun Feb 28 02:47:40 IST 2016,Murray starting off hot. #bbn #gobigblue #UKvsVandy
wyeager,Sun Feb 28 02:35:56 IST 2016,Ok @CBS this game is over. Move in to #UKvsVandy
wyeager,Sat Feb 27 21:45:45 IST 2016,It's game day!! #bbn #gobigblue #putmeincoach https://t.co/RzqW0ekiO0
wyeager,Sat Feb 27 21:15:36 IST 2016,I like winter but am ready for spring. Snow snow go away.
wyeager,Sat Feb 27 05:43:13 IST 2016,@ccsalyers @jeremytackett nah. Sounds like a play for a possible vp slot.
wyeager,Sat Feb 27 05:36:21 IST 2016,@jeremytackett @ccsalyers however I go back to where this all started. He is not evil. Obama is not evil. Wrong. Misguided. Not evil.
wyeager,Sat Feb 27 05:34:21 IST 2016,@jeremytackett @ccsalyers ah yes but if we end filibusters than obamacare can be voted out. It does go both ways.
wyeager,Sat Feb 27 05:32:05 IST 2016,@jeremytackett @ccsalyers I think they should have hearings and a vote but it is not a rubber stamp. A hearing does not mean confirmation
wyeager,Sat Feb 27 05:30:36 IST 2016,@jeremytackett @ccsalyers just because they have hearings doesn't mean they get voted in. Either way same result
wyeager,Sat Feb 27 05:30:00 IST 2016,@jeremytackett @ccsalyers but if they vote him or her down will it make any difference?
wyeager,Sat Feb 27 05:29:42 IST 2016,@jeremytackett @ccsalyers see I think this is part of checks and balances. I think he should nominate. I think senate should debate
wyeager,Sat Feb 27 05:28:31 IST 2016,@ccsalyers @jeremytackett he won't get anything done. He has a separate agenda from both parties.
wyeager,Sat Feb 27 05:27:04 IST 2016,@jeremytackett @ccsalyers and it's the whole. It's judicial decisions and executive orders and a sense that people votes don't matter
wyeager,Sat Feb 27 05:26:11 IST 2016,@jeremytackett @ccsalyers trump is a temper tantrum. Doesn't mean what created him isn't a problem
wyeager,Sat Feb 27 05:24:47 IST 2016,@jeremytackett @ccsalyers the positions of evangelicals are legislated and voted on. Gay marriage in ca. Liberty bills in Ind.
wyeager,Sat Feb 27 05:22:07 IST 2016,"@jeremytackett @ccsalyers at the same time the judicial system legislates from the bench. So people are fed up with the ""establishment"""
wyeager,Sat Feb 27 05:21:29 IST 2016,@jeremytackett @ccsalyers pres Obama used executive order bypassing congress. He unilaterally set policy. The anger is a response to this
wyeager,Sat Feb 27 05:19:23 IST 2016,@ccsalyers @jeremytackett there is always a third party. Libertarian. Green. I will find someone
wyeager,Sat Feb 27 05:18:54 IST 2016,@jeremytackett @ccsalyers trump was created by Pres Obama.
wyeager,Sat Feb 27 05:18:07 IST 2016,@ccsalyers @jeremytackett I think his nomination is inevitable. And so will be my choice to vote third party
wyeager,Sat Feb 27 05:17:30 IST 2016,@jeremytackett @ccsalyers can't afford to #FeelTheBern it costs too much.
wyeager,Sat Feb 27 05:16:26 IST 2016,@jeremytackett @ccsalyers I live in a democratic controlled state. Bureaucracy everywhere.
wyeager,Sat Feb 27 05:14:51 IST 2016,@ccsalyers @jeremytackett he also says he's a string Christian and that leaders shouldn't cuss.
wyeager,Sat Feb 27 05:13:41 IST 2016,@jeremytackett @ccsalyers at least he doesn't support planned parenthood. We need more prolife bills. Won't argue against that
wyeager,Sat Feb 27 05:12:30 IST 2016,@ccsalyers @jeremytackett it's why I can't vote for sanders or Clinton or trump.
wyeager,Sat Feb 27 05:11:26 IST 2016,@ccsalyers @jeremytackett I don't hang many heroes. No elected official is 1 to me. But give me a prolife guy over a pro choice one any day
wyeager,Sat Feb 27 05:08:11 IST 2016,@jeremytackett @ccsalyers so being obstructionist makes him evil?  Man we need to really define evil
wyeager,Sat Feb 27 04:57:59 IST 2016,@jake_rasmussen don't like them either. Too liberal.
wyeager,Fri Feb 26 10:22:44 IST 2016,@BillNance79 don't discount people who vote bandwagon
wyeager,Fri Feb 26 10:19:30 IST 2016,@BillNance79 if he wins enough contests hell will have a sizable lead. Even with proportional delegates
wyeager,Fri Feb 26 10:11:24 IST 2016,My prediction:  unless Cruz or Rubio win several contests on Tuesday this republican primary election will be over.
wyeager,Fri Feb 26 09:33:40 IST 2016,Trump just said someone should not use foul language?  Wow. Rare form tonight. #GOPDebate
wyeager,Fri Feb 26 09:31:45 IST 2016,Trump just told a hilarious joke. A strong Christian? Wow. Lol. #GOPDebate
wyeager,Fri Feb 26 09:24:04 IST 2016,This is why people support trump. What he says about politicians resonates. #sadbuttrue #GOPDebate
wyeager,Fri Feb 26 09:18:12 IST 2016,I wonder if Carson gets to have a final pitch. He never gets any other time. #GOPDebate
wyeager,Fri Feb 26 09:16:22 IST 2016,I think Zoe is probably a better candidate than most right now. #ZoeForPresident #GOPDebate
wyeager,Fri Feb 26 09:13:17 IST 2016,I'm going to start building things and charging Mexico. Trump talks about it all the time. Why can't I? #GOPDebate
wyeager,Fri Feb 26 09:07:26 IST 2016,@BillNance79 glad you didn't have to do a spit take
wyeager,Fri Feb 26 09:06:17 IST 2016,Wow the #GOPDebate has devolved into an Austin powers bit about shushing.
wyeager,Fri Feb 26 09:04:42 IST 2016,"Carson is awesome. ""Someone please attack me."" #equaltime #GOPDebate"
wyeager,Thu Feb 25 01:31:54 IST 2016,My daughter says we need to invite Donald trump to church and tell him about Jesus. She is wise and right. #wisdom

wyeager,Wed Feb 24 07:18:53 IST 2016,Can Kentucky just play tournament games in Lexington? #bbn #gobigblue #UKvsBAMA
