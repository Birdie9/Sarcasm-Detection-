GrantTBS,Sun Feb 28 10:05:10 IST 2016,"@DBHam2 I'm a Bulls fan. So, I really enjoyed watching MJ do what he did. Curry is my fav player to watch currently. Not even close."

GrantTBS,Sun Feb 28 09:58:36 IST 2016,RT @squaredK2: Man. So depressing. Watching that game and than watching the Jazz tonight. Just so much different when it comes to talent.
GrantTBS,Sun Feb 28 09:56:42 IST 2016,That was amazing. Seriously! Steph Curry. I still can't believe he pulled up from that far away to win it.
GrantTBS,Sun Feb 28 09:55:35 IST 2016,I only enjoyed watching 1 other player more. https://t.co/AIE9MVmnZ1

GrantTBS,Sun Feb 28 09:45:28 IST 2016,"@todman33 @JazDodgerUteGal so, you are  torturing yourself by watching the Jazz?"
GrantTBS,Sun Feb 28 09:44:38 IST 2016,@pmarti9 Toronto is good and I would happily cheer for them. All because of Delon.
