HayaNajjar97,Fri Feb 26 00:44:50 IST 2016,The mv is probably a wedding
HayaNajjar97,Fri Feb 26 00:28:22 IST 2016,Idk why all fandoms care about relationships more than the person they like.....ps: u can't ship real people
HayaNajjar97,Fri Feb 26 00:27:01 IST 2016,Ur only problem is its his girlfriend and he actually has feelings for her...like no shit leave him alone wtf focus on the music instead
HayaNajjar97,Fri Feb 26 00:25:53 IST 2016,He can have gigi stand with him when he sings live on stage if he wants...its his life i bet u all would be happy if it was a random model
HayaNajjar97,Fri Feb 26 00:13:05 IST 2016,u say it would be awkward if he&gigi break up when he will probably accept it as apart of his life...just like perrie's tattoo&its you
HayaNajjar97,Fri Feb 26 00:10:07 IST 2016,Zayn appreciates his past relationships i think he accepts them as apart of him thats why perrie's tattoo is still on him
HayaNajjar97,Fri Feb 26 00:09:11 IST 2016,He doesn't just bring a girl who looks good and sings an emotional song and act like they both are in love its more than that
HayaNajjar97,Fri Feb 26 00:08:16 IST 2016,"U might hate it but i really like that Zayn wants his girlfriend to be in his mv's not just a random model, his work is very personal to him"

HayaNajjar97,Thu Feb 25 23:55:54 IST 2016,Thats why he was so fuckin quiet he just dropped the new single and will drop the mv at midnight y'all

HayaNajjar97,Wed Feb 24 01:06:39 IST 2016,The kardashians 1d  zayn  jonas brothers the hadids selena justin victoria secret models put together are just a big reality show
HayaNajjar97,Tue Feb 23 20:07:23 IST 2016,on another note demi needs to chill dunno what up between her and taylor but helping kesha should not be a competition
HayaNajjar97,Tue Feb 23 20:03:16 IST 2016,we all been wondering where zayn is expecting him to drop something when he lowkey spent the week counting gigi's moles
HayaNajjar97,Tue Feb 23 19:45:28 IST 2016,I don't see him being too excited for acting!! Its not his goal to be a very successful actor
HayaNajjar97,Tue Feb 23 19:44:25 IST 2016,I have a feeling ian won't act in something else when tvd finishes he will probably focus on isf maybe produces or directs something
HayaNajjar97,Tue Feb 23 19:42:45 IST 2016,"They basically ruined the show for me with all of these seasons, it should have ended on the 4th season all of this is just meaningless"

HayaNajjar97,Tue Feb 23 18:54:01 IST 2016,If its you is the single it would have been on itunes the moment he sang it on jimmy fallon...bc delaying it makes no sense
HayaNajjar97,Tue Feb 23 18:52:24 IST 2016,And who drops the news?? Anghami like im sorry but if a new single is gonna drop soon he would have promoted that shit
HayaNajjar97,Tue Feb 23 18:50:36 IST 2016,Whats strange is that zayn never said the name of his new single like he did with PT also jimmy didn't introduce it as the new single
HayaNajjar97,Tue Feb 23 18:48:05 IST 2016,I really don't think its a good idea to drop its you as the new single specially when  everyone already heard it live
HayaNajjar97,Tue Feb 23 18:30:44 IST 2016,RT @chancchanc1236: For people Comparing Zayn and Kesha they're two different people w/two different contracts. He probably put in clauses ‚Ä¶
