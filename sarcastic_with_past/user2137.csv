AngryTorontoFan,Sat Feb 27 16:47:28 IST 2016,Big win for the #Raptors last night...apparently. Thanks for nothing @Sportsnet and @TSN_Sports. Exhibition hockey and tennis?  Really?
AngryTorontoFan,Sat Feb 27 05:43:47 IST 2016,"So a useless #NHLAlumni game is shown on @Sportsnet in Ontario, but #Raptors vs #Cavaliers is on Sportsnet One? Fire your Program Director!"
AngryTorontoFan,Fri Feb 26 17:01:25 IST 2016,"Win or lose, #Raptors have to show what they are made of tonight. Don't get blown out."

AngryTorontoFan,Tue Feb 23 16:55:00 IST 2016,The #Knicks are a very bad team. Sad to see how far they've fallen. Maybe they think because they are in NY they will get good free agents

AngryTorontoFan,Sun Feb 21 20:16:56 IST 2016,Commentators had just complemented #Kadri on his play and then he dogs it getting back on the winning goal. Doesn't help the trade value!

AngryTorontoFan,Fri Feb 19 17:14:22 IST 2016,#Canadiens are a bad team that was supposed to be good. Realizing how fragile this team truly is once they start losing

AngryTorontoFan,Tue Feb 16 17:01:53 IST 2016,Did everyone enjoy that last night? #Blackhawks just showed the #MapleLeafs what a good organization looks like. One day...maybe.
