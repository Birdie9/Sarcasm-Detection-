jaykaypee14,Fri Feb 26 23:41:46 IST 2016,@Farms9 @RickRalphTSN Maata deal as well as the Ryan Murray deal should be factors. A bridge to a point where 31 and 39 are off the books?

jaykaypee14,Tue Feb 23 20:24:21 IST 2016,"@drm_dean @JetsGirl76 the 23 man roster today vs. October 9, 2011 is not even comparable. WAY better now. Not to mention the cupboards."
jaykaypee14,Tue Feb 23 20:22:06 IST 2016,"@drm_dean @JetsGirl76 again, IF that's the case, how has TNSE failed Andrew Ladd? That's the comment you made which started this dialogue."
jaykaypee14,Tue Feb 23 20:16:56 IST 2016,"@drm_dean @JetsGirl76 if this is the case, which I don't believe it is (says he wants to be here long term), then how has TNSE failed him?"
jaykaypee14,Tue Feb 23 20:10:46 IST 2016,@drm_dean @JetsGirl76 I would suggest Ladd and his agent have failed themselves by saying no to that offer. No way he gets that on July 1.
jaykaypee14,Tue Feb 23 20:09:44 IST 2016,@drm_dean @JetsGirl76 how can you construe turning down $36M over 6 years as anything other than greed? TNSE has not failed Andrew Ladd.
jaykaypee14,Tue Feb 23 19:47:46 IST 2016,@drm_dean @JetsGirl76 it's been reported Ladd turned down $36M over 6 years. Might have to reconsider who failed who here.
jaykaypee14,Tue Feb 23 10:55:41 IST 2016,@CaptainKirk5250 @AIHJacobStoller who's to say a buyer for Pav wasn't sought out? Quite possible there were no takers whatsoever.
jaykaypee14,Tue Feb 23 10:54:29 IST 2016,@CaptainKirk5250 @AIHJacobStoller my understanding is that Pav would've had to accept the conditioning stint. My guess is he didn't.
