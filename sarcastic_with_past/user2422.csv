JakeFlippnEllis,Tue Feb 09 22:53:00 IST 2016,@CNN so if she loses by 10 points then CNN will focus on how she was initially down 30 points and how it's an actual victory for her
JakeFlippnEllis,Tue Feb 09 22:52:04 IST 2016,@CNN is so biased in supporting Hillary. They have propped her up for a win in NH even if she loses by politicizing initial poll results
