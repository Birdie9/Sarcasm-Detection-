Terry155,Wed Mar 23 06:42:29 IST 2016,@TSN1290Radio Got to be Nic Petan! #JETSFANFAVE
Terry155,Wed Mar 23 06:41:23 IST 2016,"@TroyWestwood @ICdave Man, is Petan having a game! Nice to see what our young guys can do when they're playing with talent & not muckers"
Terry155,Wed Mar 23 06:02:58 IST 2016,@TroyWestwood @ICdave @friesensunmedia This game sure looks like two teams trying their best to finish as low as possible.
Terry155,Tue Mar 22 23:41:57 IST 2016,@friesensunmedia There's the second indication! #playforauston
Terry155,Mon Mar 21 03:31:58 IST 2016,@Teddier so the coaches have figured out how to ruin this too
Terry155,Mon Mar 21 03:11:44 IST 2016,"@TroyWestwood @ICdave @NorthEndRick Had makings of perfect game; close, entertaining but we had to go & ruin it with the tie #playforauston"
Terry155,Mon Mar 21 02:27:34 IST 2016,@NorthEndRick @TroyWestwood Just seems like his skill set is t transferring to the next level. Agree he has been unmemorable
Terry155,Mon Mar 21 01:21:56 IST 2016,@WinnipegNews Link to the article is not working.
Terry155,Sun Mar 20 07:44:44 IST 2016,@ICdave @TroyWestwood @hustlerama A lot of fun watching this Michigan - Minnesota hockey game.
Terry155,Sun Mar 20 07:37:58 IST 2016,Kyle Connor is at it again! https://t.co/OIsBckdy60
Terry155,Sat Mar 19 22:31:13 IST 2016,@IllegalCurve Ahhhh. Thanks for the response. Always enjoy the show!
Terry155,Sat Mar 19 19:58:08 IST 2016,"@IllegalCurve @ICdave @ICdrew Also, don't teams have to expose something like 25% of the cap?"
Terry155,Sat Mar 19 19:56:15 IST 2016,@IllegalCurve Hi guys! Don't forget Stafford. He's another one that you have to decide on.
Terry155,Sat Mar 19 06:01:15 IST 2016,Thank you @NHLJets for the excellent production & thank you Jet fans for staying classy! https://t.co/PQVv1w51ZZ
Terry155,Fri Mar 18 08:34:40 IST 2016,@AwSSum @blgrieb Celebration was the best!
Terry155,Thu Mar 17 09:23:50 IST 2016,@DarrinBauming @WFPEdTait I like your result better than mine. Did it 5 times; didn't get Jets once & COL had 1st pick 3/5 times.
Terry155,Thu Mar 17 09:17:54 IST 2016,@NorthEndRick @lavixen67 You are one sick man and I feel sorry for your sig other
Terry155,Thu Mar 17 09:16:55 IST 2016,@troy @ICdave Got to agree with @NorthEndRick. Lipon having best game since being called up. Has finished some nice checks.
Terry155,Thu Mar 17 08:49:01 IST 2016,@TroyWestwood @ICdave Jets play is uninspired at best. Making CGY look like an all-star team.

Terry155,Thu Mar 17 08:21:39 IST 2016,"@NHL_Campbell If he starts as #1 next season, then something terribly wrong. Salary shouldn't dictate starting position"
Terry155,Thu Mar 17 08:19:03 IST 2016,"@DeGrootWPG @TroyWestwood @ICdave If he's the #1 goalie going in to next season, then something will be wrong. Salary shouldn't dictate"
Terry155,Thu Mar 17 08:05:20 IST 2016,@TroyWestwood @NorthEndRick The best thing we could do to ensure a higher draft pick is continue to leave Hutchinson on the bench.
Terry155,Thu Mar 17 07:56:02 IST 2016,"@ICdave @TroyWestwood @NorthEndRick LOL. The unnamed ""you're""."
Terry155,Thu Mar 17 07:53:43 IST 2016,"@TroyWestwood @ICdave @NorthEndRick So, you're saying if Pav had his stick in his hand (odd thing to expect) CGY wouldn't have scored?"
Terry155,Thu Mar 17 07:45:00 IST 2016,"@kfraserthecall Hi Kerry! Your thoughts on the goal review in CGY. If goalie's foot out of crease & skater comes across, is it interference?"
Terry155,Thu Mar 17 07:40:22 IST 2016,@TroyWestwood @ICdave Remember the days when you touched a forward after a dump in it was called interference?
Terry155,Wed Mar 16 02:14:53 IST 2016,"@cityofwinnipeg In addition, looks like someone has pushed the sign down. The bus stop sign across the street is also down."
Terry155,Wed Mar 16 02:01:25 IST 2016,"@cityofwinnipeg East bound Warde at Ashworth, stop sign has been either knocked down or removed. Hi speed traffic eastbound"
Terry155,Wed Mar 16 01:29:48 IST 2016,@Casey_71 @hustlerama @mremis How about Candice & Valerie Bure?
Terry155,Tue Mar 15 09:36:58 IST 2016,@Teddier Nice to see Burmi starting to shoot instead of just dancing around.
Terry155,Sun Mar 13 22:51:54 IST 2016,"@NHLJets Please, please, please make this happen. #Kroppy is our Kate Smith, for any of you old school Flyer fans! https://t.co/Kd3f3jkTjC"

Terry155,Sun Mar 13 07:16:25 IST 2016,"@RobMahon19 @TroyWestwood He is going to look extremely good in a @NHLJets uniform, whenever that may be."
Terry155,Sun Mar 13 07:14:32 IST 2016,@rhynoman11 @TroyWestwood @WFPEdTait That HAS to happen. Can't go another season with this.
