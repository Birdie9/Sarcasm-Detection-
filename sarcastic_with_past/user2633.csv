At least I know I still fit the criteria of anorexia-bp. #sarcasm 

The dsm needs to straighten that shit out"
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 20:45:13 IST 2016,Anxious as fuck. My dads coming to pick me up in an hour. I feel so fat.
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 20:44:32 IST 2016,I'm not going to weigh myself today because my weight doesn't define me.
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 13:30:13 IST 2016,Idk why I'm so angry right now. Everything is pissing me off
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 13:29:36 IST 2016,I can't always take care of everyone
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 13:28:03 IST 2016,"I always sit here thinking
What the fuck am I doing?
Like for real? What is my purpose"
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 13:24:07 IST 2016,"Isn't it sad to notice your irritability and anxiety never goes down to ""none""? https://t.co/fbRArsd2kV"
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 13:20:28 IST 2016,I'm so tired but my mind is racing.
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 13:19:40 IST 2016,"Idk what am I supposed to say?
Hey dad. Its been a while dad.
How's life dad. Yeah I'm still in school
No I have no life plan, dad."
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 13:18:18 IST 2016,I'm really freaked out.
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 13:17:53 IST 2016,Seeing my dad in 9 hours and I haven't slept yet. Fml
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 13:08:21 IST 2016,"Part of me is like
""I need to fast for a month""

And the other part is like
""That still wouldn't be enough"""
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 13:07:29 IST 2016,"Just so you guys know, this poll won't change if I take them or not. Just curious of your opinions"
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 13:06:44 IST 2016,"But even if I got down to 78 lbs, I wouldn't be happy"
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 13:05:27 IST 2016,I really want to lose 20 lbs.
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 12:59:43 IST 2016,Should I even take my meds? Like they make a difference but a really small one..
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 12:52:38 IST 2016,"RT @OneTinyTweet: ""But you don't look like you have an eating disorder"" that would be because it is a MENTAL illness #EDAW2016"
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 12:05:32 IST 2016,Do you guys see a difference in my tweets when I'm off my meds?
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 12:02:51 IST 2016,"@bombgirlx oh and since you know about this, do you know what Stan means??"
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 12:01:28 IST 2016,@bombgirlx but your explanation makes more sense. Sort of. Idk I'm just annoyed by everything lol
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 12:00:48 IST 2016,"@bombgirlx then I'm sure it's getting misinterpreted bc my friend is like ""I ship you two"" about me and my bf"
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 11:59:49 IST 2016,"The worst part is it takes me hours, sometimes even days for me to realize it didn't even happen"
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 11:58:54 IST 2016,Most of the time my scenarios start out quite positively and then something takes a turn & I'm sitting in the corner crying and pull my hair
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 11:57:40 IST 2016,Most of my arguments are with my own mind. How sad is that?
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 11:57:05 IST 2016,Does anyone else make scenarios in their heads and gets riled up over nothing?
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 11:55:05 IST 2016,"""I ship this""

I can't even continue with this bc I'm going to go on a rampage."
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 11:54:11 IST 2016,I'm sorry but these short hand things piss me off. Ship is a word already. Like be original at least.
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 11:53:20 IST 2016,Is it really that hard to write the three other letters before? Like wor-ship. Not hard.
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 11:52:35 IST 2016,"Why the fuck are people saying 

""I ship this couple"" 

Where the fuck are you shipping them to?"
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 11:49:53 IST 2016,These things take time or else no one would be suffering from these damn demons
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 11:49:22 IST 2016,"I can't just eat
I can't just think positive
I can't just let it go
I can't just think of other things

I cant bc I have a mental illness"
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 11:47:11 IST 2016,"I don't have the energy
to tell my family and friends 
that I cannot just turn off my mind.
So i just smile and nod to make them feel better"
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 11:45:58 IST 2016,"The number of times people said
""Just eat. Just be happy.
Don't listen to your mind""

And I just nodded and smiled
Is fucking astounding."
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 11:44:27 IST 2016,"It simply doesn't make any fucking sense. And the ignorant posts people make about EDs and mental illnesses, make themselves look fkn stupid"
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 11:42:44 IST 2016,"How are people still
so fucking ignorant?

Anorexia isn't the only ED

You can't tell us to ""just eat""

You can't tell us to ""just be happy"""

FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 11:39:57 IST 2016,@delicatefailure thanks.
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 11:39:33 IST 2016,@delicatefailure it's always easier to see the bright side when you're not crouched under your own cloud of gloom.
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 11:35:02 IST 2016,And i was hoping for a future in design. Well I can forget that. No organization will want a mediocre designer.
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 11:33:29 IST 2016,Oh I got my graphic design grade back for my project and got low 70's. I haven't gotten a grade that low in years. So yeah. Kill me.
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 11:32:23 IST 2016,Why? Why do i want to destroy myself. I'm a fucking psycho without them. But I just can't take them. Wtf am I doing?
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 11:31:13 IST 2016,"Idk. I don't want to take my meds. I know I'm so much worse without them but I just have this repeating thought in my head ""don't take meds"""
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 11:29:36 IST 2016,I've obsessed with my past and my dad for so many years. Everything made sense& now it doesn't. and I'm not even sure what in talking about

FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 11:03:39 IST 2016,I'm so anxious/irritated that I could break my own teeth rn. Struggling to not grind my teeth together
FleursdeIaLune,Wed Feb 24 10:55:19 IST 2016,Why is it such a big deal when we don't eat? Shouldn't we celebrate the times we do without any compensation afterwards?
