christielee008,Sat Apr 11 18:27:10 IST 2015,And they told me not to let anyone at the dealership see her or they won't let me walk away! Oh Corrina...♡♡♡
christielee008,Sat Apr 11 18:25:20 IST 2015,"Two gentlemen at the Toyota service center just praised me because my '09 Corolla, Corrina, is in such great condition!! ♡"

christielee008,Fri Apr 10 18:51:25 IST 2015,@steponmemaysick  Her performance of #BitchImMadonna was pretty epic...was interesting to hear and see her while she wasn't singing.
christielee008,Fri Apr 10 18:48:37 IST 2015,"In other news, it's still raining and gray out so I'm thinking #Pittsburgh is the new #Forks and we should be on the lookout for vampires."
christielee008,Fri Apr 10 10:24:11 IST 2015,@johnwhaskell And hey where are you going for hiatus? You should stop by Pittsburgh so we can meet!!

christielee008,Fri Apr 10 08:27:43 IST 2015,@naddiyj22 Yes but WPXI said the heaviest hit areas will be north of the city.
christielee008,Fri Apr 10 08:26:56 IST 2015,@steponmemaysick It's only because everybody I follow on Twitter from the show has tweeted about it including Mr.Fallon several times.
christielee008,Fri Apr 10 08:24:40 IST 2015,@naddiyj22 Sorry amiga. The lightening and thunder have chilled out over here. Hope you get your power back on soon!
christielee008,Fri Apr 10 08:14:39 IST 2015,The fact that Troy still has a year left in his contract but would rather retire as a #Steeler than be cut & play for someone else. #respect
christielee008,Fri Apr 10 08:10:40 IST 2015,"@jimmyfallon @Madonna Maybe a little ""Crazy For You?"" It's my favvvv ♡ and I'm excited to see the show buddy! Only an hour left!"

christielee008,Thu Apr 09 07:08:32 IST 2015,There are so many different people in this #twitter world & sometimes it's hard not to get creeped out. I wonder how celebrities do it.
christielee008,Thu Apr 09 06:38:46 IST 2015,Excellent. Another Lincoln commerical starring Matthew McConaughey.  Can't wait to see who pokes fun at this one!

christielee008,Sun Apr 05 16:40:26 IST 2015,How will you celebrate today??? #HappyEaster indeed! For my Savior lives!!!!
christielee008,Sun Apr 05 16:39:49 IST 2015,What an unbelievable day to celebrate.  Someone conquered death! Someone named Jesus who was the Son of God. Someone who died for you.
christielee008,Sun Apr 05 16:38:12 IST 2015,"But those that have been called have a purpose for their time here. And even though we make mistakes, we're covered because of Jesus!"
christielee008,Sun Apr 05 16:36:39 IST 2015,But it is possible! With God all things are possible! What's the point of life if there is nothing but death? You lead a purpose-less life.
christielee008,Sun Apr 05 16:35:38 IST 2015,It's called the Holy Spirit. And it comes to anyone who believes and lives for God! Imagine walking around with that  power inside you!
christielee008,Sun Apr 05 16:34:35 IST 2015,"Such God news for those who believe the Son of Man was real! And even more the power that raised Jesus from the dead, we can have it too."
christielee008,Sun Apr 05 16:33:36 IST 2015,He literally died and received a burial but God raised him FROM THE DEAD!!! Do you know anyone else that has awoken from death?
christielee008,Sun Apr 05 16:32:38 IST 2015,"Goooooood Morning!!! The man that died for you on Friday is up and walking, talking, and wanting to see you. You've got to come see him!!!!"
