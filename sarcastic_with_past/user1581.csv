TonyPostma,Mon Feb 29 05:35:58 IST 2016,@KevinPauga does a Michigan win here mean MSU is a double bye with winning out?
TonyPostma,Mon Feb 29 04:57:26 IST 2016,"@joerexrode Strictly on a seeding basis, MSU wants a UM win tonight?"
TonyPostma,Mon Feb 29 04:55:18 IST 2016,"@Graham_Couch we are one Iowa win against Indiana from a crazy final weekend, correct?"
TonyPostma,Mon Feb 29 03:29:43 IST 2016,@TheOrangeCone @Estebones88 @KeselowskiBrian Didn't Harvick have a 5 second slower stop?  What was the gap when the caution came out? #close
TonyPostma,Mon Feb 29 03:05:35 IST 2016,@TheOrangeCone did they not display the yellow until JJ took the white(not that it mattered)?

TonyPostma,Sun Feb 28 02:08:25 IST 2016,About time that Kyle Busch kid catches a break and wins a Xfinity race.
TonyPostma,Sat Feb 27 09:14:08 IST 2016,@NWIOren @Graham_Couch and somehow that's only the second best game in the league tonight.
TonyPostma,Sat Feb 27 05:25:39 IST 2016,"RT @IndyOreo: FYI, the 2-seat #IndyCar used for celeb/media rides is 0.8 sec  a lap faster than the #NASCAR track record at @PhoenixRaceway"

TonyPostma,Mon Feb 22 03:08:08 IST 2016,Thank goodness this isn't tandem racing. It's more entertaining to just watch them ride around.
TonyPostma,Mon Feb 22 02:41:34 IST 2016,@TheOrangeCone would finally have been right
