wgellis,Wed Feb 24 09:56:26 IST 2016,@DavidLimbaugh Who knos? How mny hookers r self-identfied evangelicals now? I guess the way 2 beat DT is 2 dumb down further. Bevis? Butthd?
wgellis,Wed Feb 24 09:49:49 IST 2016,@KSoltisAnderson Glengarry Glen Ross....one of the unappreciated greats.
wgellis,Wed Feb 24 09:46:04 IST 2016,@DLoesch Oh yeah. ðŸ˜†
wgellis,Wed Feb 24 08:24:10 IST 2016,"@KSoltisAnderson Ever notice how ""regular"" people recite talking points like they're reading from a script? Brainwashed or tru believers?"

wgellis,Wed Feb 24 08:07:29 IST 2016,@annmarienyc @BreitbartNews I wish. I figured him for a murder-suicide by now.
wgellis,Wed Feb 24 08:06:19 IST 2016,@mollyesque I'm in.
wgellis,Wed Feb 24 08:05:19 IST 2016,@dibbriggs @KennedyNation @ClayFragulia Oh 4 crying out loud.
wgellis,Wed Feb 24 08:04:17 IST 2016,"@amandacarpenter Cold, dry, humorless and dimwitted. Other than that..."
wgellis,Wed Feb 24 08:03:31 IST 2016,@BreitbartNews That should finish off Kasich.
wgellis,Wed Feb 24 08:03:04 IST 2016,@amandacarpenter Only for people from which wealth transfer is expected.
wgellis,Wed Feb 24 08:01:37 IST 2016,@elainaplott @stephenfhayes Uh...Nevada. Not exactly known for high character.
wgellis,Wed Feb 24 07:58:28 IST 2016,@mollyesque With rattle snakes and jack rabbits in the majority. Oh...and hookers.
wgellis,Wed Feb 24 07:57:38 IST 2016,@KennedyNation @ClayFragulia Oh yeah...so what shoes did u have on? Huh?
wgellis,Wed Feb 24 07:56:11 IST 2016,@MAnotGinger @realDonaldTrump Ever wonder how it is Trump seems to always turn up where the mob has a heavy influence.
wgellis,Wed Feb 24 07:54:48 IST 2016,@MAnotGinger @realDonaldTrump Nevada. Enuf said. Same people elect Reid repeatedly.
wgellis,Wed Feb 24 07:49:50 IST 2016,"@amandacarpenter Please don't use ""Clinton"" and "" mounting"" in the same sentence."
wgellis,Wed Feb 24 07:07:11 IST 2016,@KennedyNation I want cookies! ðŸ˜•
wgellis,Wed Feb 24 06:46:11 IST 2016,@amandacarpenter Not sure I can take another Dim town hall.
wgellis,Wed Feb 24 04:58:11 IST 2016,@daveweigel @MichelleFields Donald Trump or John Gotti?
wgellis,Wed Feb 24 04:55:31 IST 2016,"@williamdbatesuk @amandacarpenter Specter. Ugh. Another unprincipled anything-for-a-vote guy. Switched to Democrat, voted 4 Obamacare."
wgellis,Wed Feb 24 04:35:32 IST 2016,@williamdbatesuk @amandacarpenter I had no familiarity till a) fired by Trump b) became a go-to on-air spokesman. Seemed fishy...as does he.
wgellis,Wed Feb 24 04:32:52 IST 2016,"@Kathryne1960 ...and still, no follower of Trump seems to care. I guess vandalizing our future is simply too much fun."
wgellis,Wed Feb 24 04:31:26 IST 2016,"@williamdbatesuk @amandacarpenter And in any event, a history in politics isn't exactly the hallmark of character."
wgellis,Wed Feb 24 04:30:26 IST 2016,@williamdbatesuk @amandacarpenter Character doesn't come and go...and these latest attacks reveal a questionable character. 1/2
wgellis,Wed Feb 24 04:26:28 IST 2016,@amandacarpenter My BS alarm screams every time I see this Stone guy....but the fact that he was a Trump adviser certainly makes sense.
wgellis,Wed Feb 24 03:00:07 IST 2016,@DavidLimbaugh @DLoesch An excellent article by the way. Nail on head.
wgellis,Wed Feb 24 00:30:24 IST 2016,@GarrettVentry @amandacarpenter @AlexConant You ever get the feeling Rubio is constantly baiting the media/candidates?
wgellis,Tue Feb 23 22:28:26 IST 2016,@HeyTammyBruce Soon to blame the loss of metadata collection.
wgellis,Tue Feb 23 22:27:51 IST 2016,@DavidLimbaugh Relocating Obama seems like a good idea. Did I miss something? :)
wgellis,Tue Feb 23 22:27:04 IST 2016,@DavidLimbaugh The absolute truth! 50 yrs of getting the shrt end of compromise got us here. Incremental steps 2 hell still get you to hell.
wgellis,Tue Feb 23 22:06:46 IST 2016,@DavidLimbaugh I think you've built an infinite loop here.
wgellis,Tue Feb 23 21:21:21 IST 2016,@realDonaldTrump @StevenMeyers11 @Vogelsong1 @EdRollins @FoxNews Ed Rollins is a personality-free pull-string doll. Can't make eye contact.
wgellis,Tue Feb 23 21:19:35 IST 2016,"@redsteeze @MAnotGinger ""consider""....ok....but it's likely to take 11 months or so to ""consider"". Have it your way."
wgellis,Tue Feb 23 21:17:49 IST 2016,@wbkrebs @AndreaTantaros Thanks Wm. Reading summaries-I think I get it. Just politics now. I wouldn't invest too much defending this hill.
wgellis,Tue Feb 23 20:55:56 IST 2016,"@wbkrebs @AndreaTantaros Seems to me that the jurisdictional disposition of the ""enemy combatant"" should travel with the ""enemy combatant""."
wgellis,Tue Feb 23 20:49:29 IST 2016,@wbkrebs @AndreaTantaros So jurisdiction changes based upon which soil is under the enemy combatant's feet? Seems pedantic.
wgellis,Tue Feb 23 20:24:49 IST 2016,@AndreaTantaros Why is moving enemy combatants to an isolated stateside max security prison a problem. Gitmo as a mil base stays open right?
wgellis,Tue Feb 23 20:23:24 IST 2016,"@DavidLimbaugh Why is moving enemy combatants to an isolated stateside max security prison a problem? Gitmo as a mil base continues, right?"
wgellis,Tue Feb 23 20:09:11 IST 2016,@HeyTammyBruce Uh...don't we need a rocket...and a crew capsule? smh
wgellis,Tue Feb 23 20:08:36 IST 2016,"@kevincorke @HeyTammyBruce @FoxNews Not sure y enemy combatnts can't be kept n segregated stateside max securty. Give this, withhold SCOTUS."
wgellis,Tue Feb 23 20:05:13 IST 2016,@HeyTammyBruce Investing your trust in an unprincipled narcissist doesn't seem all that hopeful. Closer to vandalism.
wgellis,Tue Feb 23 09:48:45 IST 2016,@seanmdav @RiverKing_A16 In the war where truth & substance are pitted against entertainment & ratings....guess which wins?
wgellis,Tue Feb 23 09:44:40 IST 2016,@DLoesch I decided to watch another entertaining liar: Better Call Saul. Saul good.
wgellis,Tue Feb 23 09:18:26 IST 2016,"@DLoesch @pzf If u told me John Gotti said it, I'd believe it."
