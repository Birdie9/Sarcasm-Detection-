JeffGignac,Wed Jan 13 08:21:24 IST 2016,@kellyshefferman @KevyBhoy79 Looks like the new Navagatr Guide was pushed out today. Probably causing your issues!
JeffGignac,Wed Jan 13 08:20:33 IST 2016,@KevyBhoy79 I see the new Navagtr Guide on my box so I guess they are pushing out the update.  Reboot the box a few times you should be OK

JeffGignac,Wed Jan 13 07:49:13 IST 2016,@kellyshefferman @KevyBhoy79 Two different boxes have done that.  Time to take your current box and get a new refurbished box

JeffGignac,Wed Jan 13 04:42:59 IST 2016,@KevyBhoy79 my box froze yesterday after an update. Took a few reboots before it was stable. Lol. Maybe time for a new box

JeffGignac,Wed Jan 13 02:26:32 IST 2016,@KevyBhoy79 if we ever have a drink I will share my thoughts. Please remind me
JeffGignac,Wed Jan 13 02:25:02 IST 2016,@KevyBhoy79 FML. I should have drove. Hate my life
JeffGignac,Wed Jan 13 02:17:59 IST 2016,@KevyBhoy79 FML took the train today. Now trains cancelled due to death. Guess I am Ubering home
JeffGignac,Tue Jan 12 19:30:52 IST 2016,@VanstoneL When you are done work you should go and drive for Uber. Make a little extra Phantom $$$

JeffGignac,Tue Jan 12 10:09:07 IST 2016,#BAMAvsCLEM Wow - TE on the wheel route and no one covered him?  Mental error by the deep guy?  Bama leads but lots of ball left to play
JeffGignac,Tue Jan 12 09:58:15 IST 2016,@KevyBhoy79 Right

JeffGignac,Tue Jan 12 07:44:34 IST 2016,@KevyBhoy79 That was a great double move by the WR but the Mike should have dropped back to help and not ready to play the run

JeffGignac,Tue Jan 12 07:40:35 IST 2016,@KevyBhoy79 That was a bad bad series for Bama after the great return!
JeffGignac,Tue Jan 12 07:32:08 IST 2016,@KevyBhoy79 I know I know.  I have both TSN 1 & TSN 2 on.  But now i am pissed TSN threw to a commercial in the middle of discussion
JeffGignac,Tue Jan 12 07:28:57 IST 2016,Thank you to @TSN_Sports for showing the @espn Megacast Film Room. Love listening to people who really understand the game like we do
JeffGignac,Tue Jan 12 07:25:25 IST 2016,"I am looking forward to seeing @KingHenry_2 at the @nfl combine.
Could he be running like that for the @dallascowboys next year? #BAMAvsCLEM"

JeffGignac,Tue Jan 12 07:13:19 IST 2016,@KevyBhoy79 Your Jets top need is OLB so watch Regland on Bama could be an interesting pick up for you if he can move outside.
JeffGignac,Tue Jan 12 07:06:13 IST 2016,@KevyBhoy79 Alexander was a game time decision but everyone knew he was playing.  Nice stop on Heisman winner too bad for the flag
JeffGignac,Tue Jan 12 07:05:04 IST 2016,@KevyBhoy79 Cool.. Glad they deferred!!
JeffGignac,Tue Jan 12 07:02:52 IST 2016,@KevyBhoy79 I like your pick.
