JDeePGH,Fri Mar 25 17:14:38 IST 2016,"@thepointofpgh I agree, but moving Cutch to No. 2 doesn't constitute the Pirates setting a trend. You cited two stars already hitting there."
JDeePGH,Thu Mar 24 06:38:15 IST 2016,@jeffgreer_cj I picked Maryland to win the championship. KU must be defeated tomorrow night.
JDeePGH,Fri Mar 18 18:52:29 IST 2016,"@lbhuntpgh 13-3, but I didn't lose any Sweet 16 teams. Not bad."
JDeePGH,Thu Mar 17 19:05:04 IST 2016,@colin_dunlap The tourney falls on my birthday/vacation wk each yr. It was better when 1st/2nd rd started on Tues. But still the best wk.
JDeePGH,Thu Mar 17 00:43:18 IST 2016,"@adamdberry @LetsGoWVPower Two innings as a starter for the Dodgers, in Colorado. Allowed one run. No decision."
JDeePGH,Wed Mar 16 23:51:23 IST 2016,"@adamdberry He has me asking, ""How is THAT guy NOT a starter?!"""
JDeePGH,Wed Mar 16 08:07:56 IST 2016,@MattGajtka .. and criticize Beachum for leaving for the money?
JDeePGH,Wed Mar 16 06:11:59 IST 2016,I wonder what effect this will have on @937theFan? https://t.co/iie164BGae
JDeePGH,Wed Mar 16 02:05:26 IST 2016,"@MarioLemieuxFdn I got my charity bag today: @GaryRobertsHPT and @EricFehr signed pucks, among other nice prizes. Worth the donation!"
JDeePGH,Mon Mar 14 20:12:54 IST 2016,"@DanWetzel Hypocritical podcast. Pans the new show format, keeps referencing the bracket leak, but no discussion of it for 13 minutes."
JDeePGH,Mon Mar 14 05:01:09 IST 2016,@MartyCaridi I think they'll go back to the old format next year. They acknowledged (sarcastically) the beating they took on social media.
JDeePGH,Mon Mar 14 04:33:07 IST 2016,"@MartyCaridi @TMZ @ericsports had it first, I think."
JDeePGH,Mon Mar 14 04:28:40 IST 2016,@937theFan @colin_dunlap What are the chances Boeheim wet himself when the 'Cuse were announced?
JDeePGH,Mon Mar 14 03:59:05 IST 2016,@WillGravesAP CBS will reveal an hour before game time.
JDeePGH,Mon Mar 14 01:28:17 IST 2016,@MattGajtka At least she has her eyes on the game.
JDeePGH,Sun Mar 13 21:58:18 IST 2016,@ROOTSPORTSPIT Is there a way to watch old episodes of Inside @Pirates Baseball?
JDeePGH,Sun Mar 13 04:19:01 IST 2016,@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump You forgot to mention that the most recent poll - your own - has Kasich in front by five points.
JDeePGH,Sun Mar 13 03:42:50 IST 2016,Adding insult to injury .. literally. https://t.co/W6LELW7zsr
JDeePGH,Sat Mar 12 19:02:21 IST 2016,@lbhuntpgh Not sure. Silver lining: He's not on ANY show I listen to/watch.
JDeePGH,Sat Mar 12 18:58:46 IST 2016,"@lbhuntpgh I liked his expletive-laced rant in ""Knocked Up"", though."
JDeePGH,Sat Mar 12 08:14:56 IST 2016,@robneyer Shutting it down rather than working on some sort of compromise? I thought that was Cruz's thing.
JDeePGH,Sat Mar 12 07:07:49 IST 2016,@PirateNation22 The stupid part is that Crosby either didn't know the rule or thought he could get away with that.
JDeePGH,Sat Mar 12 06:43:38 IST 2016,@robneyer Perhaps. But it says a lot about his inability to be a peacemaker. How do you think our smaller allies feel about it?
JDeePGH,Fri Mar 11 03:26:14 IST 2016,@jeffgreer_cj I don't see Jamie Dixon getting linked to that one.
JDeePGH,Wed Mar 09 16:44:57 IST 2016,@PaulZeise He still fell further behind in the delegate count for the day. He spooned water out of his sinking ship.
JDeePGH,Wed Mar 09 07:59:33 IST 2016,@DannyMcNh2 Will he even make it to Florida next Tuesday? And will he lose by less than a 2-1 margin there?
JDeePGH,Wed Mar 09 07:54:37 IST 2016,@robneyer @realDonaldTrump Has anyone checked with John Rocker?
JDeePGH,Wed Mar 09 07:28:13 IST 2016,"@PantherLair If you're currently using Windows 8, that's a HELL YEAH!"
JDeePGH,Sun Mar 06 21:48:47 IST 2016,@KatieStrangESPN I prefer seeing Leyland launching into an expletive-laced tirade at Bonds during camp. @Pirates
JDeePGH,Sun Mar 06 21:33:50 IST 2016,"@stephenjnesbitt 4th, sorry."
JDeePGH,Sun Mar 06 21:33:04 IST 2016,"@stephenjnesbitt Spoken like a writer in a city whose team is 23rd in 3-pointers, despite being 3rd in 3-point percentage."
JDeePGH,Sun Mar 06 07:57:40 IST 2016,@mpopchock @kbarnes_pghsprt Ask same group how the Pens got in trouble: Trying to win now. But they don't see the contradiction.
JDeePGH,Sun Mar 06 07:56:40 IST 2016,"@mpopchock @kbarnes_pghsprt Ask a Pens fan what the Pirates are doing wrong: not trying to ""win now"". (cont.)"
JDeePGH,Sun Mar 06 05:35:55 IST 2016,Timing of @espn's showing Danny Ferry couldn't be better. Think he supports @realDonaldTrump? #racist
JDeePGH,Sun Mar 06 04:55:31 IST 2016,@kbarnes_pghsprt @mpopchock Rutherford traded a draft pick for Schultz a week ago. He still hasn't played. Better win with win-now strategy.
JDeePGH,Sun Mar 06 04:44:34 IST 2016,@kbarnes_pghsprt @mpopchock It feels so good to read that.
JDeePGH,Sun Mar 06 04:35:09 IST 2016,@mpopchock @kbarnes_pghsprt Pens record says they're sub-.500 on the road. Tough 4-game trip ahead. Tomorrow is LARGE!
JDeePGH,Sun Mar 06 04:25:21 IST 2016,@mpopchock @kbarnes_pghsprt I hope you're not counting Artis among the two or three for Pitt. He's been awful in their last five losses.
JDeePGH,Sun Mar 06 02:47:16 IST 2016,"@JoeStarkey1 Jamel Artis shooting % in last five losses: .200, .250, .231, .125, .222"
JDeePGH,Fri Mar 04 06:08:55 IST 2016,@C_Haynes85 @Buster_ESPN Three teams from the NL Central made the playoffs last year. The bottom two in the division are even worse. #repeat
JDeePGH,Fri Mar 04 04:32:42 IST 2016,Submitted my order for a @penguins Charity Night on @ROOTSPORTSPIT prize bag shortly after 5:45 pm. Great benefit for the @MarioLemieuxFdn.
JDeePGH,Sun Feb 28 20:06:36 IST 2016,@Ken_Rosenthal More money than QO?
JDeePGH,Sun Feb 28 19:19:14 IST 2016,@BiertempfelTrib Answers my question. Trout ($1 mil) and Howard ($900k) got long-term deals after making bigger pre-arb money.
JDeePGH,Sat Feb 27 20:43:23 IST 2016,"@KGorman_Trib @CWNCBOYSBBALL @chasingdat_ring It's the new ""I'm going to Disney(world/land)."""
JDeePGH,Fri Feb 26 07:57:24 IST 2016,I wish @OldTakesExposed focused on politics for just one night!
JDeePGH,Wed Feb 24 07:16:46 IST 2016,@TribSports @RobRossi_Trib No need to make a win worth three if you make a loss worth zero.
JDeePGH,Mon Feb 22 06:26:21 IST 2016,@JPerrotto @williamfleitch What about Eddie Gaedel's No. 1/8?
JDeePGH,Mon Feb 22 05:40:09 IST 2016,@GoodmanESPN @jeffgreer_cj BC tanking for the top pick. Wait ..
