MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 22:42:01 IST 2016,@LucyAppa @AthenaKokkali @BrooksDslbrooks @zoyaroses @MonicaStolfa Oh but why? It went so well this time! #sarcasm
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 09:19:44 IST 2016,@karen_fink @zoyaroses @LucyAppa He apologized for his part but she never apologized for accusing him of murder? Nice @NCIS_CBS
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 09:13:55 IST 2016,@zoyaroses @LucyAppa @karen_fink Is that where she says goodbye and he says goodnight?
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 09:11:38 IST 2016,@LucyAppa @lvjk @karen_fink I saw he said that. That's pretty strong feelings. Tony is the best and deserves to portrayed accordingly.
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 09:09:14 IST 2016,@LucyAppa @karen_fink That's true. Animosity is coming out of GG and MH's pores. We smell from here!
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 09:05:17 IST 2016,@LucyAppa @lvjk @karen_fink oh brother. What a mess.
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 09:03:57 IST 2016,@LucyAppa @karen_fink Meaning before they met or bec she wanted a different outcome?
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 09:01:04 IST 2016,@karen_fink @LucyAppa What happened in the last scene?
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 08:46:55 IST 2016,@NativSwan Yeah when I watch re-runs I see through different eyes now although he always annoyed me a lot.
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 08:45:45 IST 2016,@karen_fink @ncistiva11 @NCIS_CBS Exactly Karen. It's beyond ludricous.
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 08:43:30 IST 2016,@NativSwan I will never again invest my time in a show where he or MH are involved. Stupid and in your face attitude is not appealing.
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 08:40:26 IST 2016,@NativSwan Exactly. There's only one outcome acceptable. But GG apparently only likes Tony when he's on the ground being stomped on. Geez
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 08:38:14 IST 2016,@LucyAppa @EVanLustbader @zoyaroses @karen_fink He's the only character we all equally love so let's treat him like dirt.
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 08:34:50 IST 2016,@NativSwan @Eteriy @_elsimunoz @jelenamichel Amen to that NiDane.
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 08:33:59 IST 2016,@LucyAppa @EVanLustbader I guess this was a love letter to the Jeanne and Tony shippers.See how it feels! Tony feels like crap in both cases
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 08:30:44 IST 2016,@LucyAppa @EVanLustbader I do not understand why they do that to Tony. The last ep with Jeanne in it was a good ending for both of them
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 08:20:47 IST 2016,@karen_fink @EVanLustbader @LucyAppa @zoyaroses I haven't watched it yet. 2Q: who said they were soul mates and is TIVA dead?
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 05:46:31 IST 2016,@NCIS_CBS So you'll make Tony into a homewrecker and tarnish is reputation forever? No thank you. Tiva is endgame always and forever.
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 05:40:17 IST 2016,@LucyAppa @NCIS_CBS Very good question. Why is this being re-visited exactly?
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 23:32:44 IST 2016,@BrooksDslbrooks @AthenaKokkali @donutsdebsdibs @RuthRuthdmc8 No arguments here. Time to pay up.
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 23:28:08 IST 2016,@BrooksDslbrooks @AthenaKokkali @donutsdebsdibs @RuthRuthdmc8 I agree. Not sure what the point is supposed to be. We'll soon see.
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 23:27:12 IST 2016,@BrooksDslbrooks @AthenaKokkali @donutsdebsdibs @RuthRuthdmc8 Take that promo pic and compare it to the original. It almost identical.
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 23:26:12 IST 2016,@AthenaKokkali @BrooksDslbrooks @donutsdebsdibs @RuthRuthdmc8 We should have seen Tony like that with Ziva. Would have been fantastic.
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 23:25:20 IST 2016,@AthenaKokkali @BrooksDslbrooks @donutsdebsdibs @RuthRuthdmc8 I did love seeing Tony is a relationship but she was irritating.
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 23:23:57 IST 2016,@AthenaKokkali @BrooksDslbrooks @donutsdebsdibs @RuthRuthdmc8 I think he did or he loved the idea of a normal relationship.
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 23:23:10 IST 2016,@donutsdebsdibs @AthenaKokkali @BrooksDslbrooks @RuthRuthdmc8 Then why bring her back as married if that's their end game?
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 23:19:19 IST 2016,@AthenaKokkali @BrooksDslbrooks @donutsdebsdibs @RuthRuthdmc8 Can't figure out how this plays to the end game besides clearing T of guilt.
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 23:17:24 IST 2016,@AthenaKokkali @BrooksDslbrooks @donutsdebsdibs @RuthRuthdmc8 Because you know that's important to everyone that she feels better.
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 23:16:53 IST 2016,@AthenaKokkali @BrooksDslbrooks @donutsdebsdibs @RuthRuthdmc8 Still don't think they'll cross the line. Just make Jeanne feel better.
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 23:16:02 IST 2016,@AthenaKokkali @BrooksDslbrooks @donutsdebsdibs @RuthRuthdmc8 I doubt it. His answer will be yes. He loved her. Blah blah.
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 22:40:45 IST 2016,@BrooksDslbrooks @donutsdebsdibs @RuthRuthdmc8 @NCIS_CBS @CBSTVStudios The extended promo makes me think they're re-creating that moment.
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 17:42:46 IST 2016,@MetroMumsy I doubt they will cross that line but they are promoting the possibility. It is sad.
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 06:34:53 IST 2016,@its_ashaley Thank you Ash.
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 01:01:19 IST 2016,@Ad__rianna LOL! Duh.Totally mis-read your tweet. That's a name of a book. Thanks for the heads up. I'm looking for good books to read.
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 00:54:37 IST 2016,@Ad__rianna What's the context for this saying?
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 00:46:34 IST 2016,@NCIS_CBS I can't wait for a timeline for Ziva and Tony. You'll need about 50 or more slides. 4 months versus 8 plus years. Still waiting.
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 00:33:35 IST 2016,@zoyaroses @v23474 @O2lmakesmydeyes @NCIS_CBS Nope!  They for sure know and welcome it.
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 00:30:59 IST 2016,@v23474 @O2lmakesmydeyes @zoyaroses @NCIS_CBS Have to put your two cents in when they open this door. Which they do for that reason!
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 00:29:53 IST 2016,@v23474 @O2lmakesmydeyes @zoyaroses @NCIS_CBS Which I don't think most do.They're are a few very vocal ppl who bend their ear against TIVA.
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 00:26:33 IST 2016,"@v23474 @zoyaroses @NCIS_CBS Oh definitely! On a personal note, I would trade places with her in a heartbeat!"
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 00:25:08 IST 2016,@zoyaroses @v23474 @NCIS_CBS LOL! That's an understatement.
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 00:23:30 IST 2016,@zoyaroses @v23474 Agree. They don't get any PR unless it has to do with T with anyone. They'll get a lot more when we get a TIVA history.
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 00:19:17 IST 2016,@zoyaroses @v23474 I really think this is a clearing the history and a goodbye episode.
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 00:17:44 IST 2016,@zoyaroses @v23474 @NCIS_CBS And apparently her husband knows about their history. I wonder if he's the one to ask Tony to talk with her?
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 00:15:58 IST 2016,@zoyaroses @v23474 @NCIS_CBS The premise that Jeanne and DiNozzo had a relationship is incorrect. Jeanne and DiNardo had one.
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 00:06:30 IST 2016,"@NCIS_CBS So you're promoting adultery now? Anyone or thing except Ziva,  right? Wrong - TIVA was promoted and promised. Payoff is expected!"
MelanieRizk,Mon Feb 22 04:12:03 IST 2016,@karen_fink @mote2016 @its_ashaley @VicUribe66 That's what I thought but who knows.
MelanieRizk,Mon Feb 22 03:33:19 IST 2016,@mote2016 @its_ashaley @VicUribe66 I'm sorry but no good looking male to replace a good looking male? Boy that will keep the fans happy! Not
MelanieRizk,Mon Feb 22 03:14:06 IST 2016,"@its_ashaley @VicUribe66 I heard one man, one woman. Not enough to make up for his and Ziva's loss."
MelanieRizk,Sun Feb 21 23:39:40 IST 2016,@mostx1 @MissAnnaMack Same for us. Love Michael the man and Tony the character! Thank you for writing such a dynamic and loveable character.
