vitiosuslepos,Wed Feb 24 08:33:13 IST 2016,"That campaign @netflix is unnecessary aggressive. Oh, I don't cook? Well, I should get my 2 hours over a stove tonight back"
vitiosuslepos,Wed Feb 24 08:32:08 IST 2016,I don't know who greenlit @netflix Cooked ad campaign but it doesn't actually make me want to watch based on the tone.

vitiosuslepos,Tue Feb 23 06:18:01 IST 2016,@JeffGrubb I once had a defective laptop denied warranty because of an act of god.
vitiosuslepos,Tue Feb 23 06:17:27 IST 2016,@JeffGrubb And not saying anything immediately allows them to determine if it was an act of god or not.
vitiosuslepos,Tue Feb 23 06:17:03 IST 2016,"@JeffGrubb And there are even clauses in a LOT of service contracts that absolve companies of that liability in the event of ""acts of god"""
vitiosuslepos,Tue Feb 23 06:16:21 IST 2016,"@JeffGrubb It can limit immediate liability, like they won't say shit until they're legally covered, but most don't want to confirm error"
vitiosuslepos,Tue Feb 23 06:15:28 IST 2016,@JeffGrubb And even then they can continue to deny it until proper requests are filed and legal action is taken
vitiosuslepos,Tue Feb 23 06:14:50 IST 2016,"@JeffGrubb Honestly, they're under no actual obligation to divulge information outside of a government request. even then they can avoid it"

vitiosuslepos,Sun Feb 21 23:45:23 IST 2016,"While John Constantine DOES do investigating, he isn't exactly calling himself that. Only time he has was in a scene I shouldn't share"
vitiosuslepos,Sun Feb 21 23:44:38 IST 2016,I think I figured out why Constantine always feels weird whenever DC tries to make a movie or a show: The emphasize the detective angle
