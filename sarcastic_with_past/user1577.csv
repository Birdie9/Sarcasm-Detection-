NoGreen5,Tue Mar 01 01:33:23 IST 2016,@NationPenguins so it's over now or is it time zone based as well?
NoGreen5,Mon Feb 29 23:32:03 IST 2016,@mnwild dead much? Lol wow what a boring deadline day!

NoGreen5,Mon Feb 29 23:25:56 IST 2016,"@Miranda_Rites_ his age is technically still prime, but yes production has declined. It has to be chemistry and maybe ice time or idk."
NoGreen5,Mon Feb 29 23:24:22 IST 2016,"@Miranda_Rites_ & for the record, I don't think he's not as good as b4; rather, it seems to be a matter of chemistry or lack thereof."
NoGreen5,Mon Feb 29 23:22:55 IST 2016,@Miranda_Rites_ In that case then I believe this is semantics here. Some ppl think elite is the same as franchise. He's indeed elite tho IMO
NoGreen5,Mon Feb 29 23:21:03 IST 2016,@Miranda_Rites_ or are you simply stating that TOR simply didn't have a franchise player?
NoGreen5,Mon Feb 29 23:20:20 IST 2016,@Miranda_Rites_ well maybe this is just semantics. If not Kessel then who? Phaneuf?
NoGreen5,Mon Feb 29 23:18:53 IST 2016,"@Miranda_Rites_ lots of ppl never even heard of him while he was Kovalchuks shadow at NJ. Also, Seguins and Crosbys not exactly dime/dozen."
NoGreen5,Mon Feb 29 23:15:29 IST 2016,@Miranda_Rites_ not every franchise player is as famous as Crosby or Seguin; or as productive. Look at Parise for the Wild..
NoGreen5,Mon Feb 29 23:11:33 IST 2016,@penguins how bout that pass to Hagelin in the last game? Turns out he is capable of making good plays sometimes too. Lol I like Kessel

NoGreen5,Mon Feb 29 00:54:40 IST 2016,@FlyinDutchman41 @NationPenguins likewise Letang and MAF. And no bad injuries. My fingers will be crossed for sure!!
NoGreen5,Mon Feb 29 00:53:48 IST 2016,@FlyinDutchman41 only time will tell. The final stretch will show what we're made of & whether or not Sid/Geno can be clutch players like b4
NoGreen5,Mon Feb 29 00:51:09 IST 2016,@FlyinDutchman41 when sid started dominating again in early Feb I started to get hopeful. Since then it's died down again :(. Makes me sad
NoGreen5,Mon Feb 29 00:49:34 IST 2016,@FlyinDutchman41 sadly I feel we've become a playoff team at best. Look at others' uber stacked lineups & it shows were not cup contenders.
