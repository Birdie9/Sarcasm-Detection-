jonrmcleod,Wed Feb 24 17:52:20 IST 2016,@xraymission The trash talking should be at an all time high.
jonrmcleod,Wed Feb 24 01:02:36 IST 2016,@mirtle What if Lou trades Kadri? Will Leafs analytics bloggers turn on him?
jonrmcleod,Tue Feb 23 23:31:16 IST 2016,"@alanhull I'm guessing it's something like trade Purcell, Yak, maybe Eberle and get some bigger guys who have some skill."
jonrmcleod,Tue Feb 23 23:29:40 IST 2016,@Eric_Edholm Or they're going in alphabetical order.

jonrmcleod,Tue Feb 23 21:08:58 IST 2016,"@Borisnikov I think there needs to be some sort of penalty of withdrawing, especially so late."
jonrmcleod,Mon Feb 22 23:30:23 IST 2016,@RustyKnuckler You could ask Elections Canada.
jonrmcleod,Mon Feb 22 23:06:37 IST 2016,@PrimeBane I actually tried to go to KOD for the first time today but discovered that they closed their downtown Halifax location.

jonrmcleod,Sat Feb 20 23:03:21 IST 2016,@SportsnetSpec Any news on when Nuge could return?

jonrmcleod,Fri Feb 19 23:25:15 IST 2016,"@V2Hero @NewWaveOil There are YouTube videos that show you how, if you're interested."
jonrmcleod,Fri Feb 19 23:21:56 IST 2016,@NewWaveOil @V2Hero But I've already spent too much time thinking about this. :)
jonrmcleod,Fri Feb 19 23:21:42 IST 2016,@NewWaveOil @V2Hero Thanks! I think Shannon wanted to avoid angry tweets and went with the least controversial answer.
jonrmcleod,Fri Feb 19 23:15:51 IST 2016,"@V2Hero @NewWaveOil He responded to a question (""Is Hasek in the top 20?"") and he answered yes. It was a softball question for sure."
jonrmcleod,Fri Feb 19 23:11:44 IST 2016,@V2Hero @NewWaveOil I'm not a John Shannon apologist but he said in the top 20. Theoretically he could have him top 5.
jonrmcleod,Fri Feb 19 08:57:09 IST 2016,@BruceMcCurdy Probably not.
jonrmcleod,Fri Feb 19 07:24:16 IST 2016,@Sixers Good thing you didn't trade Okafor or this would have been awkward.

jonrmcleod,Fri Feb 19 05:14:56 IST 2016,@ThomsonCam I think both the Pope and Falwell didn't make very good statements.
jonrmcleod,Fri Feb 19 02:06:20 IST 2016,@ThomsonCam The gospels actually present Jesus as not being interested in politics though the people thought the Messiah would be political.
jonrmcleod,Thu Feb 18 21:09:29 IST 2016,@ThomsonCam @JasonGregor How about participation in the skills competition being voluntary and more competitive?

jonrmcleod,Thu Feb 18 01:28:45 IST 2016,@alanhull @JasonGregor What if your targets can't be acquired (for whatever reason)? Holding onto Gryba keeps an option open.
jonrmcleod,Wed Feb 17 23:37:06 IST 2016,@BeerLeagueHeroe I'll only think about buying the shirt if you do a video wearing it and apologizing for all you've said about Hall.

jonrmcleod,Tue Feb 16 09:50:45 IST 2016,@BeerLeagueHeroe @Grammica @waddsy19 @Bastulon You're arguing about an arbitrary list. It's silly. I'd rather have McDavid than Strome.
