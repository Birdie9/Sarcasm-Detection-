mariblueruby,Fri May 08 17:02:18 IST 2015,"@PigSpotter I must say, I don't recall them ever having a roadblock there... I think they're following you.. hahaha :p"
mariblueruby,Fri May 08 16:50:44 IST 2015,@Ruanjvv01 @PigSpotter It's horrifying. It indicates the level of depravity people can stoop to for self gain.
mariblueruby,Fri May 08 16:05:40 IST 2015,@Juliedv @PigSpotter I try not to look as it's too upsetting. I do think about them regularly though & I'm really hoping for a happy ending
mariblueruby,Fri May 08 15:57:56 IST 2015,@PigSpotter I think we need to find out about an actual update somehow. I don't trust what these people say.
mariblueruby,Fri May 08 14:59:52 IST 2015,Be kind and say Thank You to a random stranger today. It might be just what they need to hear.
mariblueruby,Fri May 08 11:47:24 IST 2015,Ooooh!! Happy days! it's the Swartkops Airshow this weekend!! YAY!!
mariblueruby,Fri May 08 11:39:17 IST 2015,@PigSpotter @Veetjie1  I meant - *from where these issues stem. whoops. hahaha

mariblueruby,Fri May 08 11:06:24 IST 2015,@PigSpotter @Veetjie1 I think it's people like @OduetseG from where this issues stems in the 1st place. Lack of respect for anything living

mariblueruby,Thu May 07 21:44:08 IST 2015,@SeanIzaakse In hindsight we can all say what we wouldve done but the truth is a different matter. Lets hope these poor creatures will b OK
mariblueruby,Thu May 07 21:39:11 IST 2015,@SeanIzaakse @PigSpotter Exactly. He's just plain lying. I don't believe he gave the dogs away in the 1st place.

mariblueruby,Thu May 07 21:09:27 IST 2015,@PigSpotter @Beaujolais I still believe they would've done nothing if this didn't go viral. Bunch of lying assholes.
mariblueruby,Thu May 07 21:08:14 IST 2015,@PigSpotter @Beaujolais The article says they do know where they fled to but keeping it confidential & working with the SPCA on that side
mariblueruby,Thu May 07 21:04:20 IST 2015,@PigSpotter That face... that face... that face... *sigh*
mariblueruby,Thu May 07 21:02:47 IST 2015,"@PigSpotter You kno, the fact that he had to clarify ""I'm a family man"" and ""the they are in a good condition"" just shows he's a bullshitter"
mariblueruby,Thu May 07 21:00:13 IST 2015,@PigSpotter @chanel_5059 Oh don't forget they're trying to blame social media and not admit their own incompetence although it's been clear.
