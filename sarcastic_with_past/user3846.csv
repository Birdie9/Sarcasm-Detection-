anne_888RB,Tue Apr 07 08:32:18 IST 2015,"Torrential rain, near zero visibility and people still wont turn their f$&king lights on. 😡😡"

anne_888RB,Sun Apr 05 19:52:03 IST 2015,@lesvachesdutour I made the mistake of iPad in bed. Stupid error :/
anne_888RB,Sun Apr 05 19:50:54 IST 2015,@lesvachesdutour *yawn*
anne_888RB,Sun Apr 05 19:32:56 IST 2015,"@TerryWhenman @DelwynDicker roads closed, spectators get two races on same day. They didn’t show because we would be “confused”. Total BS!"
anne_888RB,Sun Apr 05 19:12:09 IST 2015,"Killer balloons at #RVV ? If I’d read this on twitter in the morning, I’d be convinced everyone was taking the piss!!"
anne_888RB,Sun Apr 05 18:49:50 IST 2015,Kudos to @TrekFactory for their cunning plan to get extra followers! #Fabianese #tricky #RVV
anne_888RB,Sun Apr 05 18:46:37 IST 2015,Neutral Service cars not really doing Shimano any favours today? #RVV
anne_888RB,Sun Apr 05 18:42:32 IST 2015,@PresidentWilko @tourdecouch no coverage at all despite cameras at the finish line. Apparently too much risk and too confusing? Go figure!
anne_888RB,Sun Apr 05 18:38:07 IST 2015,Such a shame for womens cycling that no one has invented split screen television yet. #RVV
anne_888RB,Sun Apr 05 18:25:27 IST 2015,RT @meowclank: #fabs will tweet if they can calm him down enough after his teammate is taken out #WTFRVV

anne_888RB,Sun Apr 05 18:07:24 IST 2015,*snort* well that’s a little obvious. Both accounts simultaneously? Someone is telling tales… No prizes for guessing who 😂😂
anne_888RB,Sun Apr 05 18:01:39 IST 2015,Yeah that Service car driver needs a new job… #RVV
anne_888RB,Sun Apr 05 17:36:13 IST 2015,"Lol, this bike race is longer than every #V8SC race this year except Sandown and Bathurst #RVV #hardmen"
anne_888RB,Sun Apr 05 17:29:54 IST 2015,Have to love a sport where you can win your weight in beer for winning an intermediate sprint. #RVV
anne_888RB,Sun Apr 05 16:46:26 IST 2015,Ah @EurosportAUS a cycling fans best friend #latenight #RVV
anne_888RB,Sun Apr 05 08:09:36 IST 2015,"@Wirlander haha yep, that one always makes me laugh. Finding their wallet like it’s the first time they’ve been shopping!"
anne_888RB,Sun Apr 05 08:01:03 IST 2015,"Why do people stand in line at cafes, get to the counter and have no idea what they are ordering? 😡"
anne_888RB,Sun Apr 05 06:33:26 IST 2015,Hairdresser = girly pampering heaven. Treating @kyliehorton84 for looking after me all week despite being sick herself 😄 #awesomefriends

anne_888RB,Sun Apr 05 06:26:46 IST 2015,@LycraJedi that’s a lot of information for a Sunday morning 😂
anne_888RB,Sun Apr 05 05:13:36 IST 2015,"… Then she wrote on FB that she was having fun without us. Someone cancelled breakfast plans, we went skiiing and I fell over 😂😂😂"
anne_888RB,Sun Apr 05 05:12:47 IST 2015,"The #firstworldproblems of the 20-somethings behind us are epic. My boyfriend thinks I’m fat, my friend cancelled partying…"

Doctors. No experience."
anne_888RB,Sat Apr 04 15:23:27 IST 2015,@MelbourneJulie @TeePee141 given he is suing ASADA I doubt that will ever come out?
anne_888RB,Sat Apr 04 15:21:24 IST 2015,@MelbourneJulie I do think that when you are systematically injecting kids with experimental drugs it’s best *not* to keep records ;)
anne_888RB,Sat Apr 04 15:11:39 IST 2015,@TeePee141 well there were confessions?
anne_888RB,Sat Apr 04 15:11:27 IST 2015,@MelbourneJulie I just can’t get over the fact that Essendon didn’t keep records and thats why they got off? Incompetence!!
anne_888RB,Sat Apr 04 14:54:54 IST 2015,"@MelbourneJulie I find the whole thing very Armstrong-esque. Didn’t test positive, suing everyone & evidence going missing. That ended well!"
anne_888RB,Sat Apr 04 14:47:13 IST 2015,"@MelbourneJulie lol, it’s running close ;)"
anne_888RB,Sat Apr 04 14:15:48 IST 2015,Small lolz at Dons fans thinking booing James Hird is just because they are Swans fans. Might hear it a few times. Or every game.
anne_888RB,Sat Apr 04 13:54:07 IST 2015,@McZameth 😂😂😂
anne_888RB,Sat Apr 04 13:52:42 IST 2015,"@McZameth you make an eggs-cellent point. Sorry, really really couldn’t help myself 😝"
anne_888RB,Sat Apr 04 13:50:54 IST 2015,"@McZameth he’s only an hour away, could go in person? Assault charge would totally be worth it!"
anne_888RB,Sat Apr 04 13:49:44 IST 2015,"The sight of James Hird on my TV just makes me want to throw a brick at the screen. Lying, immoral, systematic drug cheat."
anne_888RB,Sat Apr 04 13:45:15 IST 2015,I think my second AFL team just became “anyone playing Essendon” 💉💊💉💊💰💰
anne_888RB,Sat Apr 04 13:35:39 IST 2015,"@McZameth pffft, we’ve been eating Easter Eggs since last week 😄"
