LeafsJaysFan,Fri Feb 26 18:42:53 IST 2016,@unclebizzy4 No we don't need it.  My ONLY point was how much MORE imposing it'd be.
LeafsJaysFan,Fri Feb 26 18:38:13 IST 2016,"Don't get me wrong, I don't have any issues about Saunders other than health but I don't think he's as imposing https://t.co/qOi8q6KnWw"
LeafsJaysFan,Fri Feb 26 18:37:48 IST 2016,I agree about his last couple of years.  Not sure that Saunders is in the same category though.   https://t.co/qOi8q6KnWw

LeafsJaysFan,Fri Feb 26 18:21:46 IST 2016,"I know that Bruce may not have been the best alternative, but I can just imagine adding that bat to the lineup too lol"
LeafsJaysFan,Fri Feb 26 18:20:51 IST 2016,"@powder_blue Nothing ""shallow"" about admiring someone's looks, just the fact that you question his character shows you're not."
LeafsJaysFan,Fri Feb 26 18:19:55 IST 2016,"Last year was an anomaly for Tulo, I think he'll be back to himself this year."
