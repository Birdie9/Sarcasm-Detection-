stateofslaylor,Sun Feb 28 18:19:51 IST 2016,It's frustrating seeing tumblr edits of Brit and ben's wedding video with just Taylor's bits. Taking away from the point of the video but ok
stateofslaylor,Sun Feb 28 18:16:53 IST 2016,Taylor could've taken Calvin as her date to brit's wedding but instead she danced the night away with little kids and I am ALIVE!
