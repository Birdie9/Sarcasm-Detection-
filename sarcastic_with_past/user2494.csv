jerthorne,Thu Feb 25 09:37:41 IST 2016,My wife's brothers are really crappy at thinking about her & doing things for her. She's used to it. 2 tried to get out of her wedding.

jerthorne,Thu Feb 25 09:26:02 IST 2016,I guess the thing we all missed was that Ashley saves her smiles for very special people. David lost out big time. #marriedatfirstsight
jerthorne,Thu Feb 25 09:23:33 IST 2016,Ashley's next relationship might be compared to what she had with David. And that guy will get sick of it. #marriedatfirstsight

jerthorne,Thu Feb 25 09:10:51 IST 2016,I called it with David & Ashley. I thought he'd say yes & she'd say no. She checked a while ago yet he never gave up #MarriedAtFirstSight
jerthorne,Thu Feb 25 08:34:46 IST 2016,You can't say Ashley hasn't done anything nice for David in this experiment. She smiled at him once. #MarriedAtFirstSight

jerthorne,Thu Feb 25 06:55:11 IST 2016,@itschappy Trump's signature move is insulting people. I think he had a rough childhood and is now just pissed at people.
