CClifcorn,Wed Feb 24 11:01:44 IST 2016,@NateSilver538 should GOP be concerned that less than a quarter of voters were under 44? Only 7 percent under 29
CClifcorn,Wed Feb 24 08:40:21 IST 2016,RT @BernieSanders: .@HillaryClinton believes Republicans should set the standard for disclosure of her Wall Street speeches. Aren’t we bett…
CClifcorn,Wed Feb 24 08:29:49 IST 2016,".@HillaryClinton lumping yourself in with republicans by saying ""i will when they do"" doesn't put you in good company."
CClifcorn,Wed Feb 24 08:28:52 IST 2016,.@HillaryClinton wonders why she's held to higher standard than repub. w/pd speeches: b/c dems are supposed to represent working class
CClifcorn,Tue Feb 23 05:02:00 IST 2016,"@AlfieBCC ""if you have nothing to hide, why would you worry?"" Is the typical response people give, rather than actually thinking about it."
CClifcorn,Tue Feb 23 04:03:13 IST 2016,"Don't know what to tell anyone who thinks campaign finance reform is a ""single issue"". It's the root of sooo many problems @HillaryClinton"
CClifcorn,Tue Feb 23 03:54:38 IST 2016,@MSNBC it's irresponsible to include superdelegates in your delegate count. They can change their mind at any time.
CClifcorn,Mon Feb 22 00:05:20 IST 2016,"@MarkHalperin clinton is usurping bernie's message now, almost verbatim at times. Which is a win for him if you really think about it."

CClifcorn,Sun Feb 21 07:51:09 IST 2016,@NateSilver538 at what point does the republican establishment acknowledge that a decent portion of the electorate doesnt remember reagan?
CClifcorn,Sun Feb 21 04:07:44 IST 2016,"She wouldnt even be addressing half of what she has had Sanders not pulled her to the left, and in a big way that's a win for him."
CClifcorn,Sun Feb 21 04:06:35 IST 2016,Clinton is starting to turn her campaign around by usurping Sanders' message. Almost verbatim at times.
CClifcorn,Thu Feb 18 23:58:09 IST 2016,@BernieSanders the clinton campaign and its supporters are misrepresenting sanders as a single issue candidate. Very disingenuous.
CClifcorn,Thu Feb 18 23:57:21 IST 2016,@BernieSanders you all have to do a better job emphasizing that campaign finance affects a ton of issues. It's the root of the problem.
CClifcorn,Thu Feb 18 23:55:31 IST 2016,".@HillaryClinton that's why the ""single issue"" label is complete garbage"
CClifcorn,Thu Feb 18 23:54:49 IST 2016,.@HillaryClinton A corrupt campaign finance system is the root of soooooo many other issues. Money impacts politicians' votes.
CClifcorn,Thu Feb 18 23:53:28 IST 2016,".@HillaryClinton and her supporters are trying to label Sanders as a ""single issue"" candidate. Totally disingenuous."
CClifcorn,Thu Feb 18 09:25:31 IST 2016,.@marcorubio @tedcruz i'm sure if the shoe were on the other foot you guys would totally adhere to that same line of thought tho
CClifcorn,Thu Feb 18 09:24:40 IST 2016,.@marcorubio @tedcruz when did the presidential term become 3 years? Missed that in civics class I guess.
CClifcorn,Thu Feb 18 08:53:38 IST 2016,"@cnnbrk for the love of God, ask these guys how they can possibly cut taxes in meaningful way AND increase military spending"
CClifcorn,Thu Feb 18 08:49:59 IST 2016,.@tedcruz how do you plan to both cut taxes and expand the military's role? That doesn't make sense
CClifcorn,Thu Feb 18 08:40:46 IST 2016,.@tedcruz just wanted to be sure i had that right
CClifcorn,Thu Feb 18 08:40:25 IST 2016,".@tedcruz ""small govt"" applies to regulating the financial industry and firearms, but not social welfare programs, surveillance, military"

CClifcorn,Wed Feb 17 20:58:26 IST 2016,@ProFootballTalk why would anyone want him back? He was a liability this year.
CClifcorn,Tue Feb 16 08:42:04 IST 2016,"@dot_mhk i dont know if he did it or not, but frankly, nobody in the nfl should be beyond suspicion anymore"
CClifcorn,Tue Feb 16 08:41:28 IST 2016,"@dot_mhk just like with the hgh thing. How many great athletes have vehemently denied it, only to be found out later."
CClifcorn,Tue Feb 16 08:35:55 IST 2016,"@dot_mhk i just think it's another example of ""these guys arent role models"", and that you don't really know them as well as you think"
CClifcorn,Tue Feb 16 08:33:51 IST 2016,"@dot_mhk the 94 incident was sealed by the court, so nobody really knows what happened. King references it tho"
CClifcorn,Tue Feb 16 08:33:13 IST 2016,@dot_mhk but then why wouldnt he just be forthcoming and apologize? Why try to destroy her character?
CClifcorn,Tue Feb 16 07:27:26 IST 2016,"@dot_mhk point being, his record isnt squeeky clean and he's not the infallable person the media makes him out to be"
CClifcorn,Tue Feb 16 07:26:50 IST 2016,@dot_mhk and then there's the shady 1994 incident that nobody has been allowed to read about
CClifcorn,Tue Feb 16 07:23:54 IST 2016,@dot_mhk and to me their attempt to smear her in the book was almost as bad.
CClifcorn,Tue Feb 16 07:23:17 IST 2016,"@dot_mhk other people corroborated her story, not his. This was a woman, not a teammate. Totally inappropriate."
CClifcorn,Tue Feb 16 07:05:33 IST 2016,"@dot_mhk even if there was no contact, he still exposed himself to a university employee in an inappropriate way"
CClifcorn,Tue Feb 16 07:04:34 IST 2016,"@dot_mhk i mean even peyton's version of the story, which nobody has corroborated, is bad enough."
CClifcorn,Tue Feb 16 04:04:25 IST 2016,"@ProFootballTalk but you're right, he should have consulted someone with a legal background"
CClifcorn,Tue Feb 16 03:59:48 IST 2016,"@ProFootballTalk fair, but even if 1/2the article is true, it's still a bad look for manning. Nobody seems to have corroborated his account"
CClifcorn,Tue Feb 16 03:56:41 IST 2016,"@ProFootballTalk you're splitting hairs with this manning thing, Florio"
CClifcorn,Mon Feb 15 23:57:52 IST 2016,"@ProFootballTalk in book. Even if it's largely allegation, those points are being trivialized"
CClifcorn,Mon Feb 15 23:57:23 IST 2016,"@ProFootballTalk i mean they're allegations, but still, witnesses didnt corroborate manning's story, and it looks like they smeared her..."
CClifcorn,Mon Feb 15 23:53:28 IST 2016,@SI_DougFarrar the smearing of the writer of the story and the victim have already begun again. Unreal.
CClifcorn,Sun Feb 14 23:11:37 IST 2016,"@RossTuckerNFL why was terrell Davis a hof finalist, but freddy t cant even get consideration?"
