chipbothmann,Sun Feb 28 03:42:42 IST 2016,@StLouisGameTime Bite your tongue.  We picked up another backup goalie.  #sarcasm #layingitonprettythick
chipbothmann,Sun Feb 28 03:11:38 IST 2016,@StLouisGameTime @jprutherford Time to get Copley some work.  Pointless to keep Allen in there to get abused.
chipbothmann,Sun Feb 28 03:10:13 IST 2016,"@Chasenpucks39 No argument there, Chaser.  But the Blues are losing this game on their own."
chipbothmann,Sun Feb 28 03:00:39 IST 2016,@StLouisGameTime Outscored 11-4 over our last 7+ periods.  So we'll probably trade for a 4th liner or another goalie.  #goaliecollectors
chipbothmann,Sat Feb 27 19:43:09 IST 2016,@andystrickland So why assign him to Chicago?
chipbothmann,Sat Feb 27 19:36:37 IST 2016,"@andystrickland Getting ready to include Copley/Binnington in a deal, or just no faith in those two?"
chipbothmann,Sat Feb 27 19:20:54 IST 2016,@StLouisGameTime @jprutherford My reaction when I learned we made a trade.  For a 5th goalie.  When we can't score. https://t.co/AVAlrLZ3lg
chipbothmann,Fri Feb 26 07:29:59 IST 2016,"@StLouisGameTime Getting Ott back is going to be our ""deadline deal"" in Armstrong's mind, isn't it?"
chipbothmann,Tue Feb 23 07:13:35 IST 2016,"@StLouisGameTime This looks like a 1st round, Game 6, elimination effort.  Hitch should go full Herb Brooks at intermission.  #gatorade"
chipbothmann,Tue Feb 23 07:07:04 IST 2016,@lkorac10 Might as well get Allen some work.  The team in front of Elliott isn't giving much effort.
chipbothmann,Mon Feb 15 04:52:22 IST 2016,"@shanebacon Broadcaster jinx.  Graphic that he hadn't missed a putt inside 6 feet all week right before the putt.  You suck, CBS."

chipbothmann,Sun Jan 17 21:14:36 IST 2016,@mellinger Andy Reid coaches like the game clock has been replaced with a sundial.
chipbothmann,Sun Jan 17 00:43:28 IST 2016,@cwotd @Boulevard_Beer Hey Now!  Tank 7 in the fridge waiting for kickoff.  Go Chiefs!  #KCvsNE
chipbothmann,Sat Jan 16 18:21:01 IST 2016,@1_ChiefsKingdom Have fun today Marty!  Bring home a winner!  #ChiefsVsPats
chipbothmann,Fri Jan 15 05:49:01 IST 2016,"@FO_ScottKacsmar Absolutely.  Better than Interstellar, and I'm a Nolan guy."
chipbothmann,Wed Jan 13 08:31:44 IST 2016,@TheCatOnFox Plenty of room on the Chiefs bandwagon!  And Arrowhead is huge upgrade over that airplane hangar you used to watch games in.
chipbothmann,Sun Jan 10 10:55:48 IST 2016,@EJHradek_NHL Adam Jones...smarter than that.  Comedy gold.
chipbothmann,Fri Jan 08 01:54:10 IST 2016,@Siriusjay @MatthewBerryTMR How do you setup @ESPNFantasy to have a two win week based on H2H and Top 5 in scoring?  #emotionalfriendsleague

chipbothmann,Thu Dec 31 08:45:40 IST 2015,@allinkid Fair enough.  Thanks for replying.
chipbothmann,Thu Dec 31 05:45:22 IST 2015,"@FO_ScottKacsmar Talk about ""when you play someone""  NE and SEA were playing worst ball of their season.  Went on streak after losing to KC"
chipbothmann,Thu Dec 31 04:54:39 IST 2015,"@allinkid Is Sammy Watkins at 9 because everyone else sucks, or did you forget what Revis did to him last time they played?"
chipbothmann,Thu Dec 31 01:39:30 IST 2015,@StephStradley Thank you anyway for your time.  Good luck with the gas leak.
chipbothmann,Thu Dec 31 01:16:51 IST 2015,"@StephStradley Any idea when Wild Card tickets go on sale to public?  Want to drive down from STL for the game, not paying secondary prices."
chipbothmann,Tue Dec 29 10:39:44 IST 2015,@1_ChiefsKingdom Bengals did us a favor.  Houston's a much better opportunity to win that first playoff game in forever.
chipbothmann,Tue Dec 29 08:55:46 IST 2015,@shaytron @billbarnwell Ok.  1-4 against playoff teams so far this year.  Guess we'll see in a few weeks.
chipbothmann,Tue Dec 29 07:32:20 IST 2015,@SiriusXMFantasy @JoePisapia17 Super Bowl?  How about a playoff game?  I was college soph. last time KC won one.  43 years old now.

chipbothmann,Tue Dec 29 06:04:36 IST 2015,"@kanderna @allinkid Link to said chatter?  A friend has ""won"" his championship by 1.1, and has Murray.  Positive or negative correction?"
chipbothmann,Tue Dec 29 05:32:55 IST 2015,"@SiriusXMFantasy Up 34.8 w/McManus to play, opponent with Demaryius and Denver D.  Standard scoring.  Fearing an Arizona-like performance."
chipbothmann,Tue Dec 29 01:30:10 IST 2015,"@billbarnwell I'm a Chiefs fan, looks like a repeat of 2013.  Win 9 straight against hot garbage, then 1 and done.  Hope I'm wrong."
