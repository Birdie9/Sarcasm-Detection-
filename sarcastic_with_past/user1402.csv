faerychay,Thu Nov 26 09:25:42 IST 2015,@tsuma_mandy I had back surgery last week. My disc was bulging and putting loads of pressure on my spinal cord. Constant pain since June.

faerychay,Thu Nov 26 08:52:02 IST 2015,Apparently most people with similar issues are using a wheelchair before having surgery. Don't know if I'm tough or stupid.
