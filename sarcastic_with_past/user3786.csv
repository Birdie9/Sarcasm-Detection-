Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 07:24:31 IST 2015,@DanonymousMan Lightly raced getting better each race and was off 6 moths which helped him not get Pletchered…..
Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 07:17:48 IST 2015,"@DanonymousMan American Pharaoh, Dortmund, Carpe Diem, Materiality & Stanford"
Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 07:06:11 IST 2015,@travfourr @SeaBass912 I did use the firster. The 5 and the 6 were horrible on sheets and you didn't need a big # to win D'mato 18% Firster
Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 07:02:41 IST 2015,@SeaBass912 @travfourr The life we choose… We'll get them this week.. Back to the salt mine tomorrow and start preparing for next weekend
Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 06:59:53 IST 2015,@SeaBass912 not life changing money but some more money to make wagers this week.
Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 06:59:05 IST 2015,@SeaBass912 I know. I pushed a $ 6.00 ticket 5 times and went 3 out of 4. My frustration not only with 3 but with the 8 losing by a head.
Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 06:50:19 IST 2015,@SeaBass912 You are a better man than I. I am still pissed off… LOL...
Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 06:49:12 IST 2015,@bellringerwins On sheets he is slow but haven't seen his last number… He does everything right though.
Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 06:33:00 IST 2015,@bellringerwins and I think International Star is a bet against as well..
Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 06:32:20 IST 2015,"@bellringerwins I just think that the top three are so much better than the rest that it doesn't matter. Dortmund, Carpe Diem & American Pha"
Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 06:29:10 IST 2015,"@brooklyncowboy1 Kevin I am pretty sure you don't need to even worry about who the jockey is on El Kabeir, he is already a toss."
Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 06:24:45 IST 2015,@bellringerwins I could see that more than any of the others listed but I just don't think he is good enough.
Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 06:19:41 IST 2015,"Is any1 on twitter backing these horses in KD for the win? Frosted, El Kabeir, Tencendur, Ocho Ocho Ocho, Danzing Moon?"
Dmoney1568,Mon Apr 06 05:59:04 IST 2015,If the steelers take the OLB from Kentucky (Dupree) I will immediately sell everything I own of theirs and root for the Jets. #idiotcoach
