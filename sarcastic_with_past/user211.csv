TheRealBorourke,Sat Mar 19 10:14:41 IST 2016,RT @avinashkunnath: There are three teams from Iowa and zero teams from California in the Round of 32.
TheRealBorourke,Sat Mar 19 09:55:41 IST 2016,RT @IrrationalHawk: March. Madness. State of Iowa.
TheRealBorourke,Sat Mar 19 09:55:36 IST 2016,"RT @HawkeyeReport: And with that, three schools from the great state of Iowa are on to the round of 32. No matter who you root for, pretty â€¦"

TheRealBorourke,Sat Mar 19 03:09:41 IST 2016,RT @hasselESPN: The worst shot of Gesell's career is the best PASS of his career
TheRealBorourke,Sat Mar 19 03:08:17 IST 2016,I knew it all the time. Have faith people. #Iowa #hawkeyes
TheRealBorourke,Sat Mar 19 02:52:09 IST 2016,Iowa Basketball. They never let you down.
TheRealBorourke,Sat Mar 19 01:24:00 IST 2016,Does Fran have any idea what a timeout is? #Iowa #hawkeyes
TheRealBorourke,Sat Mar 19 01:23:42 IST 2016,RT @IrrationalHawk: Fran stands there watching them meltdown.
TheRealBorourke,Fri Mar 18 21:27:20 IST 2016,@cfrelund you are rocking it on @SportsCenter keep up the good work!
TheRealBorourke,Fri Mar 18 20:30:36 IST 2016,@IowaHawkGuy time will tell. 78-68 Hawks. You heard it here.
TheRealBorourke,Fri Mar 18 20:27:25 IST 2016,@IowaHawkGuy someone besides the top 2 have to play well. I see good games coming from sapp and woody
TheRealBorourke,Fri Mar 18 20:24:10 IST 2016,@IowaHawkGuy have to try and get the ball inside. Utilize woody some. Can't just be a jump shooting team. We gotta pound them they're small
TheRealBorourke,Fri Mar 18 20:17:47 IST 2016,@IowaHawkGuy I'm confident it comes together today and we look closer to January Iowa
TheRealBorourke,Fri Mar 18 20:16:43 IST 2016,Big day today. If we play to our potential there won't be an issues. Let's go #Hawkeyes #Iowa
TheRealBorourke,Fri Mar 18 20:14:58 IST 2016,@IowaHawkGuy the offense has been ugly lately...but I got a good feeling today buddy. Woke up with a pep in my step!
TheRealBorourke,Mon Mar 14 04:46:45 IST 2016,@IowaHawkGuy we know he doesn't like to change...evidenced by letting Mike dribble around wildly at the end of every game ;)
TheRealBorourke,Mon Mar 14 04:43:26 IST 2016,@IowaHawkGuy hopefully Fran realizes quickly the zone hasn't been working for weeks. Get physical with them.
TheRealBorourke,Mon Mar 14 04:41:44 IST 2016,"@IowaHawkGuy I like our matchup. 2 seed you'd most want to get is Nova, so assuming we get there I like our chances"
TheRealBorourke,Mon Mar 14 04:38:14 IST 2016,@IowaHawkGuy I just hope IONA runs the clones right out of the gym ha
TheRealBorourke,Mon Mar 14 04:36:17 IST 2016,"@IowaHawkGuy agree 100% on that. It's sad. Too bad teams like Monmouth get left out as well. Overall, the committee did a terrible job"
TheRealBorourke,Mon Mar 14 04:34:48 IST 2016,@IowaHawkGuy I know we finished poorly but argument could be made our resume is still better than theirs & we get a 7? Idk..B1G with no love
TheRealBorourke,Mon Mar 14 04:33:30 IST 2016,"@IowaHawkGuy idc. Can't finish 6th, lose your first tourney game, and have literally 0 road wins worth a shit...and get a 4."
TheRealBorourke,Mon Mar 14 04:18:03 IST 2016,How Indiana got a 5 seed and Iowa State got a 4 blows my mind. ISU finished SIXTH in their own conference
TheRealBorourke,Mon Mar 14 04:17:23 IST 2016,"RT @HeavensHawkeye: Win the Big Ten reg season, get a 5 seed. Finish 6th in the Big 12, get a 4 seed. Flat out ridiculous."
TheRealBorourke,Mon Mar 14 04:11:55 IST 2016,Feeling confident Iowa can turn this around and get into the sweet 16. #MarchMadness
TheRealBorourke,Mon Mar 14 04:11:08 IST 2016,Serves @CBSSports right the bracket leaked. This show has been AWFUL
TheRealBorourke,Mon Mar 14 03:30:16 IST 2016,@BarstoolBigCat better not sleep on Iowa big guy
TheRealBorourke,Mon Mar 14 03:28:33 IST 2016,And to think...about 4 weeks ago the Hawkeyes were a 1 seed for most people. Damn it. Smh. Ok time to get ready for Temple! #Iowa #hawkeyes
TheRealBorourke,Mon Mar 14 03:24:35 IST 2016,Fucking horse shit. God damn it. We deserve what we got. Damn it damn it.
TheRealBorourke,Mon Mar 14 03:20:02 IST 2016,Got a bad feeling about their thoughts on Iowa and the B1G if Michigan State didn't get a 1 seed :/
TheRealBorourke,Mon Mar 14 03:15:25 IST 2016,Michigan State just got hosed.
TheRealBorourke,Mon Mar 14 03:09:58 IST 2016,RT @Adam_Jacobi: I think Iowa will make it into the NCAA Tournament.
TheRealBorourke,Fri Mar 11 04:30:18 IST 2016,@rhoffs88 I appreciate your enthusiasm. I'm sure you can understand my hesitation in trusting that haha
TheRealBorourke,Fri Mar 11 04:26:46 IST 2016,@rhoffs88 not sure how much longer we can go with the he brought us back from nothing analogy. 6 years later. We're an avg team. I want more
TheRealBorourke,Fri Mar 11 04:01:21 IST 2016,@Hawkize pathetic is a very appropriate word to use in describing this team for the last month plus
TheRealBorourke,Fri Mar 11 03:56:57 IST 2016,"@rhoffs88 Fran has had 4 years to develop those ""midgets"" tho?"
TheRealBorourke,Fri Mar 11 03:44:18 IST 2016,"@IrrationalHawk he probably didn't even draw up a play....""trusted"" his guys to get it done"
TheRealBorourke,Fri Mar 11 03:41:20 IST 2016,@Hawkize not sure how many people said Iowa Basketball was saved by winning a 7-10 game then getting trounced by zaga
TheRealBorourke,Fri Mar 11 03:38:15 IST 2016,"@HS_BHGP @Hawkize @GarmanSports 6, 7, 8, 9....who gives a shit. They'll get bounced right away."
TheRealBorourke,Fri Mar 11 03:27:10 IST 2016,@IrrationalHawk we caught MSU early without valentine and when he was limited. It was all a mirage. We were never an elite team
TheRealBorourke,Fri Mar 11 03:26:25 IST 2016,Hate calling out college kids...but I CAN'T WAIT until Mike Gesell is gone. The dude is the least clutch athlete I've ever seen.
TheRealBorourke,Fri Mar 11 03:25:02 IST 2016,@IrrationalHawk what was fun? Watching a coaching staff and set of players consistently wilt under any kind of pressure?
TheRealBorourke,Fri Mar 11 03:24:14 IST 2016,The Hawkeyes consistently CHOKE in any big situation. Can't even draw up an inbound play. This is on COACHING.
TheRealBorourke,Fri Mar 11 03:23:37 IST 2016,That team makes me SICK. So terrible. This is on FRAN. The guy can't EVER GET HIS GUYS READY IN BIG GAMES.
TheRealBorourke,Fri Mar 11 03:21:59 IST 2016,"@IowaHawkGuy gesell can't dribble the ball, can't inbound the ball. The guy has 0 clutch gene in his body"
