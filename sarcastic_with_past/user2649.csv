JacobRiggs,Fri Feb 19 19:35:17 IST 2016,@preachersammy I like that he's not so hard nosed about immigration. Think he has best shot at beating Hillary or Bernie.
JacobRiggs,Fri Feb 19 09:27:28 IST 2016,There was nothing substantive about what Trump said tonight. It's like listening to someone read a pre-edited story from National Enquirer.

JacobRiggs,Fri Feb 19 03:40:29 IST 2016,"@JesseFOwens I love the format and feel of NPR. Crisp, cool. Just wish there was something like it with balanced content."
JacobRiggs,Fri Feb 19 03:08:33 IST 2016,Is there a radio show or podcast that isn't crazy right wing militant but is still not liberal-minded like NPR?

JacobRiggs,Thu Feb 18 21:56:27 IST 2016,@iPopEditor PS podcasting is fun when the two people are so secure in their friendship they can make fun of each other the whole time.
