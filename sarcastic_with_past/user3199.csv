ChanninLiedtke,Sun May 24 09:45:15 IST 2015,A few interesting tips here. #travel #hospitality https://t.co/9XzrhA2mum

ChanninLiedtke,Sun May 24 01:51:24 IST 2015,#Canmore: Bear by the engine bridge. Going running there with your headphones in and making no noise = bear chewtoy. @wildsmart
ChanninLiedtke,Sun May 24 00:51:40 IST 2015,@DMcWriterboy @BlueJays Whenever @JoeyBats19 steps to the plate @petermansbridge should rattle off a news update in 10 seconds.
ChanninLiedtke,Sun May 24 00:45:00 IST 2015,Is that @JoeyBats19 walk-up tune or the intro to the evening news with Walter Cronkite? @BlueJays #BlueJays
ChanninLiedtke,Sat May 23 02:53:08 IST 2015,My @mariners afternoon tea mug made me think of the late Dave Niehaus. He was one of the best in the biz. http://t.co/Ea6RIKi884
ChanninLiedtke,Fri May 22 01:53:14 IST 2015,"Claire, this is very kind. I think that you sent this tweet to the wrong guy though. https://t.co/nUYnAueZID"
ChanninLiedtke,Wed May 20 21:21:59 IST 2015,Sorry #brandchat - had to send a silly twieet before the end. Have to leave early. Great chat all!
ChanninLiedtke,Wed May 20 21:21:36 IST 2015,"A5 Ever try dropping 5,000 coupons from an airplane over a city? Sure builds awareness. :) #brandchat"
ChanninLiedtke,Wed May 20 21:19:48 IST 2015,@mariaduron @JenMitch Haha! Darn sales people. Can we all agree to not market for the sake of a cool campaign? Have a goal. #brandchat
ChanninLiedtke,Wed May 20 21:18:16 IST 2015,@JenMitch The question was about best lead gen. practices though - not about best practices to generate awareness. #brandchat
ChanninLiedtke,Wed May 20 21:17:20 IST 2015,"@jenmitch I agree that sales isn't always the goal. Breast cancer w/ NFL does a great job of awareness, for eg. #brandchat"
ChanninLiedtke,Wed May 20 21:15:15 IST 2015,@jgombita Haha! Had a good laugh. Thanks for that Judy. #brandchat
ChanninLiedtke,Wed May 20 21:14:52 IST 2015,I find it amazing how often I see BRILLIANT marketing strategies for markets where sales are almost logistically impossible. #brandchat
ChanninLiedtke,Wed May 20 21:14:12 IST 2015,A4 Best lead gen practice? Integrate sales and marketing. No point in a marketing strategy for a market with no sales presence. #brandchat
ChanninLiedtke,Wed May 20 21:10:08 IST 2015,"@jgombita Ugh. ""Gut"" sounds so whimsical. :) #brandchat"
ChanninLiedtke,Wed May 20 21:06:10 IST 2015,Truth.  https://t.co/Wfx0RCnHMU
ChanninLiedtke,Wed May 20 21:04:00 IST 2015,Analysis is important and great. I encourage everyone here to not discount intuition / following what works. Trust yourself. #brandchat
ChanninLiedtke,Wed May 20 20:59:20 IST 2015,A2 The usual online suspects are good. I also like breaking down where our guests are visiting from. #brandchat
ChanninLiedtke,Wed May 20 20:58:23 IST 2015,"RT @ORIS4COLOR: A2: @tweetreach, Google Analytics, Facebook & LinkedIn Insights are good - they're all free & provide great data! #brandchat"

ChanninLiedtke,Wed May 20 20:55:00 IST 2015,"@MaddyOsman Maddy, such a terrible definition. Still, I tried. :) #brandchat"
ChanninLiedtke,Wed May 20 20:54:37 IST 2015,@MaddyOsman It's looking at the steps a consumer takes on their purchase journey and assigning values to those steps. #brandchat
ChanninLiedtke,Wed May 20 20:48:52 IST 2015,If you have trouble breaking down why YOU purchased a certain brand of coffee then how accurate is this for consumers in general? #brandchat
ChanninLiedtke,Wed May 20 20:47:59 IST 2015,Anyone have a cup of coffee in front of them? Use an attribution model to break down why you purchased that brand of coffee. #brandchat
ChanninLiedtke,Wed May 20 20:46:19 IST 2015,I'm not suggesting that we not try. I'm suggesting that we're basically taking good guesses. #brandchat
ChanninLiedtke,Wed May 20 20:44:44 IST 2015,A1 Attribution models are sort of like trying to break down why we choose the partners that we do: almost impossible. #brandchat

ChanninLiedtke,Fri May 15 02:52:49 IST 2015,@harrisonia Maybe not even think. It's often actually catering to them. #hbrogue
ChanninLiedtke,Thu May 14 22:50:06 IST 2015,A2 Keep comm lines open. Constantly. Ask what they need in order to achieve org success. Deliver. #hbrogue
ChanninLiedtke,Thu May 14 20:23:30 IST 2015,@VizwerxGroup Too kind. Thank you. #HBRogue
ChanninLiedtke,Thu May 14 20:18:11 IST 2015,Sorry I can't make it - in meetings. This way you can talk openly about me though. :) #HBRogue  https://t.co/Cjb2bRObs4

ChanninLiedtke,Wed May 13 23:23:55 IST 2015,"@tanayag I think I'd do this if there was a personal / professional line for me. I truly can't tell the diff anymore, and that's OK. #tchat"
ChanninLiedtke,Wed May 13 23:22:45 IST 2015,@translationlady Ha! I went even more old-fashioned and said in person. If it was any more old-fashioned it would have bourbon. #tchat
ChanninLiedtke,Wed May 13 23:22:05 IST 2015,A3 I prefer an in person chat at work. I prefer an in person chat in my personal life too. Chatting is good. #tchat
ChanninLiedtke,Wed May 13 21:23:25 IST 2015,A6 Visuals works. Unique visuals work better. Drones give us unique visuals. Seems sensible... #brandchat
