alwayscrashing,Wed Feb 17 04:15:27 IST 2016,I have the song Band of Gold by Freda Payne stuck in my head. Somehow having great songs as earworms is so much worse than bad ones.

alwayscrashing,Thu Feb 04 03:16:30 IST 2016,I think it’ll probably take decades for BMW to make a driverless car. You can’t make an AI that is enough of a cunt with current technology.

alwayscrashing,Sat Jan 30 22:53:11 IST 2016,A letting agent just ‘liked’ my tweet about letting agents being shit. I’m taking this as proof that they do it on purpose.
alwayscrashing,Sat Jan 30 22:40:41 IST 2016,Despite all that I'm seemingly doing very well as a tenant compared to a lot of people I know. I'd sooner deal with it all myself.

alwayscrashing,Wed Jan 27 03:10:47 IST 2016,The comic Lucifer was a beautiful epic example of art and storytelling about free will and human existence. The tv adaptation is a cop show.
alwayscrashing,Wed Jan 27 03:02:52 IST 2016,"Well, I say Lucifer is based on Mike Carey’s comic spin-off about the character from Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman, but it really isn’t. At all."
alwayscrashing,Wed Jan 27 02:52:39 IST 2016,"This new tv series, Lucifer (based on one of my favourite comic series ever) is complete fucking drivel."
