mtc,Fri Feb 26 08:33:27 IST 2016,@VitalVegas Won‚Äôt somebody think of the money
mtc,Fri Feb 26 08:24:47 IST 2016,"‚ÄúI won‚Äôt let people die for lack of enough money to take care of themselves.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhoa man what the hell who let you in here‚Äù
‚ÄîA Real Thing"
mtc,Fri Feb 26 02:48:02 IST 2016,@R_Pickle @The_Katbot Did the localization ever get less laughable? Digimon‚Äôs and YuGiOh‚Äôs dubs are almost punchline fodder today.
mtc,Fri Feb 26 02:42:31 IST 2016,All you mothertruckers who said you‚Äôd rather have a rolling chattering soccer ball instead of a neon light cycle are liars.
mtc,Thu Feb 25 23:58:48 IST 2016,@The_Katbot Is it even always the same guy? I remember a later game had the guy from Red/Blue as an outcast on a mountain.
mtc,Thu Feb 25 09:59:37 IST 2016,@PlayStation Galak-Z is an actual good game from the past year. You guys are finally getting it. üëç
mtc,Thu Feb 25 00:29:25 IST 2016,@DavidUzumeri People are just getting hype for 2020‚Äôs Kanye/Trump debates.
mtc,Wed Feb 24 04:09:45 IST 2016,"Let‚Äôs check in on my Twitter Trend Calendar:

Previous: Lonely valentines tweets
Now: Fun Bun tweets
Soon: Spring Training stats freakouts"
mtc,Wed Feb 24 03:45:06 IST 2016,"@DanRyckert Like, my understanding of wrestling is everybody knows who everybody is, and there‚Äôs a carousel of guys who will play anything."
mtc,Wed Feb 24 03:44:45 IST 2016,@DanRyckert Their Wikipedia entry says that early on there were two members that were pulled and nobody knows who they are? Seems unusual.
mtc,Wed Feb 24 02:43:27 IST 2016,@detroit1051 ‚ÄòGetting jack[ed]‚Äô is up there with ‚Äúlost my shirt‚Äù in the Big Loser terminology.
mtc,Wed Feb 24 02:41:37 IST 2016,"@detroit1051 I know casino names don‚Äôt matter (M, D, Aria), but using a slang for getting ripped off or having nothing seems exceptional."
mtc,Wed Feb 24 02:05:04 IST 2016,"@alex_navarro I see your actual room essentially IS the top floor of Moscone West. Well, my sympathies, hope you don‚Äôt have anxiety issues."
mtc,Wed Feb 24 02:04:26 IST 2016,"@alex_navarro That‚Äôs Benaroya Hall in Seattle. It‚Äôs a symphony chamber, not Moscone West."
mtc,Wed Feb 24 01:44:32 IST 2016,"@The_Katbot Or rather there is regionalism, but not hyper-regionalism: There‚Äôs no equivalent of someone going from Red Sox to the Yankees."
mtc,Wed Feb 24 01:43:32 IST 2016,"@The_Katbot That‚Äôs kind of the schism with esports: the teams are just brands, the players are more what matters. There‚Äôs no regionalism."
mtc,Wed Feb 24 01:42:31 IST 2016,"@The_Katbot But a lot of people who root the Sox will always root the Sox regardless of players. I don‚Äôt root for NaVi, I root for Dendi."
mtc,Wed Feb 24 01:41:26 IST 2016,"@The_Katbot Oh, I know they‚Äôre not. I have an NFL/NBA/NHL team preference myself. I‚Äôm just saying, sports often are a big time sink."
mtc,Wed Feb 24 01:39:32 IST 2016,"@The_Katbot Making it worse is teams form and collapse a lot, and people move around a lot. This was really bad in Dota until about 6mo ago."
mtc,Wed Feb 24 01:38:50 IST 2016,"@The_Katbot I think an issue is gamers (outside of NFL sims etc) generally don‚Äôt like most real sports, and don‚Äôt get ‚Äúcheering for laundry‚Äù"
mtc,Wed Feb 24 01:37:30 IST 2016,"@The_Katbot And honestly, to me many players actually do have personalities. It‚Äôs fairly easy to see who is nice and who is a jerk."
mtc,Wed Feb 24 01:34:03 IST 2016,@The_Katbot I'd tell anyone who asks why I watch Dota to see TI3 or TI5. Except both are like three days of 12 hours of programming.
mtc,Wed Feb 24 01:29:20 IST 2016,"@VitalVegas Dunno if arena builders spoke to EVO management at all, they seem happy at Bally's after changing hotels every few years."
mtc,Wed Feb 24 01:26:05 IST 2016,"@VitalVegas And while I do watch people play video games in tournaments, it's nothing new. Look at EVO, which is on the Strip every year."
mtc,Wed Feb 24 01:24:10 IST 2016,@VitalVegas All these companies freak out about making gamblers out of the first generation to make less than their parents. I don't get it.
mtc,Wed Feb 24 01:23:21 IST 2016,"@VitalVegas As much as I would love a Smash TV slot or Cruisin USA slot with the gearshift, I don't know if I'd play it because money."
mtc,Tue Feb 23 11:52:16 IST 2016,"@Shinogu @nadiaoxford Not only does the item say what it is in Japanese, but guards refer to it. In FF2 they say ‚Äúcomplete your mission.‚Äù"
mtc,Tue Feb 23 11:51:08 IST 2016,@Shinogu @nadiaoxford ‚ÄúIt seems His Majesty sent us to this village to wipe out the Summoners‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúIncredible!‚Äù
mtc,Tue Feb 23 11:41:37 IST 2016,"@nadiaoxford It‚Äôs really weird that the Japanese script actually says what‚Äôs in the Mist Valley package, given how shocked Cecil & Kain are."
mtc,Tue Feb 23 10:33:48 IST 2016,@VitalVegas That's way too intense. Going through The Park is going to feel like being funneled into a magenta supernova.

mtc,Tue Feb 23 07:49:19 IST 2016,@mikesuszek Shane has been the missing man while StepHHH took the estate the past few years. ‚ÄúFight For Your Inheritance‚Äù seems inevitable.
mtc,Tue Feb 23 07:44:44 IST 2016,"@mikesuszek If there was a casino that took bets, I‚Äôd wager Vince/HHH vs Shane/Roman happens by June."
mtc,Tue Feb 23 06:52:14 IST 2016,@FreshNEasyBuzz How is this supposed to be different than their Trader Joe‚Äôs?
mtc,Tue Feb 23 05:21:47 IST 2016,@DLthings Looks like Schewrin Castle by way of Venice. At least DL is obvious Neuschwanstein and WDW/TDL obviously Meggenhorn.
mtc,Tue Feb 23 04:12:10 IST 2016,@megaloltaku I thought ‚Äúgrowing up‚Äù was buying furniture that‚Äôs nicer and less disposable than IKEA.
mtc,Tue Feb 23 02:02:13 IST 2016,.@RalstonReports story on @SenatorReid makes me think NV should lose early state influence. No point if the machine swings it. #WeDontMatter
mtc,Tue Feb 23 01:08:18 IST 2016,"@The_Katbot I‚Äôm sure a lot of people love the old team, but the current team name is 90s ‚ÄúCorporate Edgy‚Äù and I can see hipsters rebelling."
mtc,Tue Feb 23 01:05:03 IST 2016,"@The_Katbot The logo rules, and ‚ÄúWild‚Äù is possibly the most XFL name in pro sports. Can‚Äôt blame ‚Äòem."
mtc,Tue Feb 23 01:01:22 IST 2016,@jonathan_katz I guess I shouldn‚Äôt hold my breath for your Vegas comedy club. ;b
mtc,Mon Feb 22 12:13:08 IST 2016,"I‚Äôm okay with the Pete‚Äôs Dragon remake if it‚Äôs completely divorced of it‚Äôs funky 1970s culture. Jungle Book, though, I dunno."
mtc,Mon Feb 22 12:07:26 IST 2016,"@DLthings Lost amid the pop songs, movie stars, Modern Family cast, etc, a gently old man says ‚ÄúFrom all of us at Walt Disney Productions‚Ä¶‚Äù"
mtc,Mon Feb 22 12:00:41 IST 2016,"@DLthings I would even buy another souvenir map of cartoon buildings not-to-scale if it included ‚ÄúA Land Far, Far Away.‚Äù"
mtc,Mon Feb 22 11:59:46 IST 2016,"@DLthings Studios doesn‚Äôt have lands, though. It‚Äôd be hilarious if they went with ‚ÄúA Galaxy Far Far Away.‚Äù"
mtc,Mon Feb 22 11:55:11 IST 2016,"@DLthings While we call it that informally, it‚Äôs officially Unnamed Star Wars Themed Land. Expect ‚ÄúThe Star Wars Experience‚Äù or whatever."
mtc,Mon Feb 22 11:50:23 IST 2016,@DLthings Though to be honest they've never quite understood how to market future attractions since Walt stopped touring shop floors on TV.
mtc,Mon Feb 22 11:48:11 IST 2016,"@DLthings Also there's less things open and the cost is so high. This is the ""stay home"" year. Talk to us when stuff is about to open."
mtc,Mon Feb 22 11:42:37 IST 2016,"@DLthings I dont know about you, but I learned a lot. Disneyland used to be ONE park!"
mtc,Mon Feb 22 11:38:51 IST 2016,"@DLthings I wonder if it's timed to include commercials, since my DVR automatically cuts them out."
