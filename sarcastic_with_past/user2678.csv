sgowsmith1988,Tue Feb 23 09:19:13 IST 2016,@farmerjase Bracewell quite an unlucky bowler. Has bowled well without much success.
sgowsmith1988,Tue Feb 23 09:18:46 IST 2016,"Also pitches so flat these days, don't break up like they used to. And when an anomaly comes along such as Nagpur it's a bad pitch. #NZvAUS"

sgowsmith1988,Tue Feb 23 09:11:36 IST 2016,Boult and Southee not as penetrative in recent times as usually are. Boult 27 wickets in last 8 tests. Southee 26 in last 8 tests. #NZvAUS
sgowsmith1988,Tue Feb 23 08:22:25 IST 2016,@farmerjase I remember when Stuart Broad's batting got so bad they dropped him to ten. Same thing should happen to Southee.
