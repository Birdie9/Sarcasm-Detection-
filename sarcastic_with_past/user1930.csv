FTC_21,Sun Feb 28 19:38:44 IST 2016,Sunday striker and somehow I entered 5 lineups.  Hoping for gold from 6% owned Jack Cork
FTC_21,Sat Feb 27 21:20:01 IST 2016,Congrats to all the donkeys who have Shane Long in their lineup #DFS
FTC_21,Sat Feb 27 20:09:09 IST 2016,@DFS_hambazaza fade him
FTC_21,Sat Feb 27 20:07:16 IST 2016,Must. Stop. Tweaking. EPL. Lineups.

FTC_21,Thu Feb 25 17:59:40 IST 2016,@TheFantasyGolf there's always one asshole who needs to pick the firs six out so he can see his name at the top.
FTC_21,Thu Feb 25 05:35:42 IST 2016,Josh Hart 4% owned in the Splash?  Yes please.
FTC_21,Thu Feb 25 02:06:01 IST 2016,@mattbirnbach don't jinx it
FTC_21,Thu Feb 25 01:37:13 IST 2016,Dammit Sterling take the guy on.

FTC_21,Thu Feb 25 01:19:59 IST 2016,Loving the low ownership of City's attack in Tues striker.  Will love it more if they do something.
FTC_21,Thu Feb 25 01:17:02 IST 2016,@RotoWireAndrew @mattbirnbach I'll know who to yell at then....
FTC_21,Thu Feb 25 01:14:58 IST 2016,@mattbirnbach @RotoWireAndrew considered rostering one of them as a boom/bust but went safe.  Having no Yaya scares me more.
FTC_21,Thu Feb 25 01:07:04 IST 2016,@Razzle11Grinds usually not a game logger but can't help but notice recent road performances for DJackson are less than desirable.
FTC_21,Thu Feb 25 01:06:25 IST 2016,"@DFS_hambazaza gonna need it, figured the Barca fwds needed to go 30+ to matter at their $.  Messi hit, I was close to a successful fade tho"
FTC_21,Thu Feb 25 01:05:03 IST 2016,"@DFS_hambazaza only played Suarez in 1 of 5 LUs.  Faded all Barca and Bayern pretty much, so eggs in the City basket.  I'll likely be wrong"
FTC_21,Thu Feb 25 01:01:40 IST 2016,"@RotoWireAndrew I have all the Aguero and Silva, like @mattbirnbach I'm convinced City goes on a tear tonight.  And I'll likely be wrong."
FTC_21,Thu Feb 25 00:57:34 IST 2016,"@DFS_hambazaza really?  Come on, CL games first."
FTC_21,Thu Feb 25 00:56:01 IST 2016,"Finding all of my lineups falling on Guardado for PSV, hope they get some corners today.  #DFS"

FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 21:19:20 IST 2016,I LOVE THE POORLY EDUCATED is trending thanks to people who are looking to be angry about something/ need to get the stick out of their ass.
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 21:15:55 IST 2016,@Razzle11Grinds @Rotowire_Alex pick on LSU the rest of the way?  Can't see Ben giving a shit about the rest of the season.
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 03:47:48 IST 2016,@Rotowire_Alex @DFS_hambazaza I have all the David Silva
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 03:28:58 IST 2016,"@Rotowire_Alex @DFS_hambazaza good move, might regret fading him but have this stupid suspicion about City tomorrow"
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 03:21:28 IST 2016,"@Rotowire_Alex @DFS_hambazaza just couldn't pull the trigger on Messi or Muller.  Hoping Aguero comes good, have a little Griezmann too"

FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 02:53:40 IST 2016,"@DFS_hambazaza 5 lineups, only Barca forward I have is Suarez in one of them.  Have one lineup with only Dybala from today.  Liking that one"
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 02:37:51 IST 2016,ALL THE DAMN DYBALA!
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 02:34:42 IST 2016,How does a team with Juve's pedigree allow Robben to do just about the only thing he can do anymore? https://t.co/7FxyQyHZ7i
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 02:33:18 IST 2016,So far the correct answer is Bayern stack
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 01:47:14 IST 2016,@AlZeidenfeld the only footballer I've ever had hatred for
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 01:19:41 IST 2016,7% owned Mandzukic works for me #narrative
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 01:06:15 IST 2016,@DrewDinkmeyer probably should consider fetal position AND mass intoxication in leg 2
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 01:04:30 IST 2016,@DrewDinkmeyer Fetal Position is probably more necessary when the play at the Camp Nou in leg 2.
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 01:02:43 IST 2016,"@DrewDinkmeyer It won't be so bad, I'm calling 1-1, and have almost no exposure to this game."
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 01:00:10 IST 2016,@RotoWireAndrew I surprisingly have very little exposure to the two games today.  Will leave it at that.
FTC_21,Tue Feb 23 23:48:07 IST 2016,"@Rotowire_Alex @RotoWireAndrew re: Alexis, I think he can wait until this weekend lol"
FTC_21,Tue Feb 23 23:42:13 IST 2016,"@RotoWireAndrew @Rotowire_Alex still have visions of how he abused David Luiz in Paris last year, can't tell me Mertesacker can do better"
FTC_21,Tue Feb 23 23:41:03 IST 2016,"@RotoWireAndrew @Rotowire_Alex never said it wasn't risky, out of the three if I did play one it would be Suarez"
FTC_21,Tue Feb 23 23:38:15 IST 2016,@Rotowire_Alex @RotoWireAndrew Arsenal buoyed by beating Bayern at home + Barca rd of 16 away leg not always bearing fruit.  2 reasons why
FTC_21,Tue Feb 23 23:32:41 IST 2016,@Rotowire_Alex @RotoWireAndrew it's going to take at least 30 DK points and maybe 35 for Messi.  And if I think the game ends 1-1.....
