I can deal. #sarcastic"
Glass1ncision,Tue Jan 12 00:21:52 IST 2016,"@roiben Yes, it's all about prioritizing. Once I get into the classes a bit more I'll know what works for me."
Glass1ncision,Tue Jan 12 00:19:58 IST 2016,"@Doesnt_matter84 Thanks, I'll know more about this tomorrow. I'm hoping for good news."

Glass1ncision,Mon Jan 11 22:56:35 IST 2016,--Help me!
Glass1ncision,Mon Jan 11 22:56:17 IST 2016,"@roiben Thank you, I'm a bit scared of the high demands on three of four classes. I am devoted to education but this is a bit overloaded."
Glass1ncision,Mon Jan 11 22:54:39 IST 2016,..It's safe to say in a couple of weeks I may be AWOL on social media until the middle of June.
Glass1ncision,Mon Jan 11 22:53:51 IST 2016,"..Plus I have a Crisis Intervention class that requires national certification also. 

Then I have Therapeutic Mental Health Techniques."
Glass1ncision,Mon Jan 11 22:52:34 IST 2016,..Like the Nurses Aid's state exam I will have to pass a comprehensive final and a national exam to be certified in Mental Health Dx.
Glass1ncision,Mon Jan 11 22:51:40 IST 2016,..I thought my Nurse Aid class would be the most demanding yet my Mental Health Diagnostics course is the same equivalent.
Glass1ncision,Mon Jan 11 22:50:29 IST 2016,"..It's accurate in saying this is the most demanding semester I have ever taken, however, I just realized how demanding it will be. #omg"
Glass1ncision,Mon Jan 11 22:48:43 IST 2016,"--Sigh, what in the hell did I get myself into this #college semester?

After reading the syllabus for four courses, I'm speechless. #omg"
Glass1ncision,Mon Jan 11 19:19:45 IST 2016,"--My connection has re-set itself multiple times this morning already, I hope that's not a sign of things to come. Displeased & frustrated."
Glass1ncision,Mon Jan 11 17:30:21 IST 2016,"--Due to problems regarding collage aid I have refused to get excited, in fact I held off all happiness too but I can't contain either. ❤-❤"
Glass1ncision,Mon Jan 11 17:20:48 IST 2016,"--My excitement in regards to college is far beyond what I tried so hard to contain, I awoke at 5am to look at my class course information!"
Glass1ncision,Mon Jan 11 17:11:03 IST 2016,..I've already completed one mandatory online exam in Mental Health Diagnostics & finished my first week course work in Therapeutic Tech.
Glass1ncision,Mon Jan 11 16:53:35 IST 2016,"--I am so deeply excited about starting this semester, with my class line up it will be the best & most demanding semester yet. #college"

Glass1ncision,Mon Jan 11 03:33:05 IST 2016,@Purrpatrol @MHponderland As we grow I believe we become more present. I am sorry that others bullied you with those harsh words. #bpdchat
Glass1ncision,Mon Jan 11 03:32:01 IST 2016,@CarlDunnJr Perhaps it would be a good topic to discuss someday. #bpdchat
Glass1ncision,Mon Jan 11 03:31:30 IST 2016,@Borderline_OK I can also understand that. I'm unsure how properly categorize it to some debilitating & to others it's helpful. #bpdchat
