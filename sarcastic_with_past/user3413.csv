morganbailey94,Tue May 05 08:40:18 IST 2015,I really am not okay with getting a 10% on this final which brought me down to a C for the class. I had an A.
morganbailey94,Tue May 05 08:20:54 IST 2015,So you best believe my professor has an email waiting for her from me! And I would have done it yesterday if the dang wifi hadn't gone down
morganbailey94,Tue May 05 08:20:03 IST 2015,"I copied and pasted my answers tho cause even though it graded only the first 10, it still kept me in the exam and timed it...."
morganbailey94,Tue May 05 08:19:21 IST 2015,Frak. Exam kicked me out after first 10 questions. Out of 90. Think I accidentally hit my mouse with my book and it went outside page...

morganbailey94,Sun May 03 22:31:34 IST 2015,So much for doing those exams. Don't understand why you had to do this right now.
morganbailey94,Sun May 03 22:30:41 IST 2015,You do what you want when you want and don't care who it affects.
morganbailey94,Sun May 03 22:30:41 IST 2015,Cool. I wasn't trying to do an exam or anything you ass wipe. God. This is why I hate you.
