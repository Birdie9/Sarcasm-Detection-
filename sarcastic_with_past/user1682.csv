SteveAustinWI,Mon Feb 29 19:15:59 IST 2016,Seeing even more calling for Rubio and Cruz to join together and Rubio to give speech saying Gang of 8 substantive mistake. #sarcasm
SteveAustinWI,Mon Feb 29 19:15:09 IST 2016,Seeing lots of blogs and columns out there on how the GOP needs to have Kasich and Carson drop out of the race after Tuesday. #sarcasm

SteveAustinWI,Mon Feb 29 07:05:44 IST 2016,@RohnWBishop we should take bets on amounts of weight Christie gains now that he's out. I say he has 75 pounds back on by August
SteveAustinWI,Mon Feb 29 06:57:08 IST 2016,Trump is still in Celebrity Apprentice mode pretending he's fighting with Meatloaf and Gary Busey. May not be capable of pivot.
SteveAustinWI,Mon Feb 29 06:56:19 IST 2016,"That said, one thing I was totally wrong on w/Trump is he hasn't pivoted to ""Presidential"". This thing would be wrapped up if he had."
SteveAustinWI,Mon Feb 29 06:55:23 IST 2016,"2. Trump obviously worked phones hard for these, which indicates he has significant skills. Harness em for good and world might not end."
SteveAustinWI,Mon Feb 29 06:54:43 IST 2016,As people vent on Sessions & Christie endorsements a couple things to consider. 1. If Trump were toxic in their states this wouldn't occur
SteveAustinWI,Mon Feb 29 06:46:32 IST 2016,"These ""scores"" never rank votes by importance. Gang of 8 vote same weight as one for a dairy farm bill.  https://t.co/YjAcnixzPU"

SteveAustinWI,Mon Feb 29 00:53:48 IST 2016,We can survive splitting the vote on 3/1. But after that two guys have to drop. It's as simple as that. And Kasich is clearly one of them.
SteveAustinWI,Mon Feb 29 00:52:41 IST 2016,"And that math is you can't have three guys (Kasich, Cruz, Rubio) splitting the vote up different ways in all key states on 3/1, 3/8, 3/15"

SteveAustinWI,Mon Feb 29 00:32:27 IST 2016,@JayCostTWS Except of course the fact Kasich is going to suck away a ton of potential Rubio votes in all three of those states.

SteveAustinWI,Mon Feb 29 00:30:04 IST 2016,@dick_nixon I'd make the argument Trump actually has best chance of big 3 in GOP actually winning the general. If Trump pivoted to sane.
SteveAustinWI,Mon Feb 29 00:29:11 IST 2016,@ShannonPoe Rubio can do us all a fantastic favor by being the guy who takes out Trump and clears way for Ted.
SteveAustinWI,Mon Feb 29 00:28:35 IST 2016,This is why personally I think Rubio is highly problematic. GOPe fawn all over him. Trump voters stay home in Nov. https://t.co/glr14zfBQV
