creamytrumpet,Wed Jun 24 22:14:41 IST 2015,@ThisisC4RL that is particularly erotic for some reason old enuf not go ott but this time.....by Jove #kleenex
creamytrumpet,Wed Jun 24 21:26:49 IST 2015,@AsdaServiceTeam Like all supermarkets you treat us the customers  that make your profits with contempt. We're not fools treat us as such
creamytrumpet,Wed Jun 24 21:24:41 IST 2015,@AsdaServiceTeam You won't admit that by making subtle changes to peoples accounts Asda think they can influence peoples shopping habits
creamytrumpet,Wed Jun 24 21:20:51 IST 2015,@AsdaServiceTeam As this Phenomenon has been a regular thing for the last 2 years and no other anomalies occur ie rip offs I think not.
creamytrumpet,Wed Jun 24 19:15:45 IST 2015,@AsdaServiceTeam I don't need help with my favourites list. I need Asda to leave it alone. I will be the best judge of what I wish to buy.
creamytrumpet,Wed Jun 24 10:53:29 IST 2015,@AsdaServiceTeam I await inane answers with baited(excuse the pun) breath #gettingnowhere
creamytrumpet,Wed Jun 24 10:51:09 IST 2015,@AsdaServiceTeam  Used to buy salmon mozzarela parcels online from fsh  counter now  choice is 5 different types of fish only all pre packed
creamytrumpet,Wed Jun 24 10:45:50 IST 2015,@AsdaServiceTeam In my account there is a favourites tab of previous purchases. Asda arbitrarily change items in my favorites list
creamytrumpet,Tue Jun 23 21:07:29 IST 2015,@AsdaServiceTeam Also why put stuff never purchased on my favourites list? How can it be a favourite if never bought by me?
creamytrumpet,Tue Jun 23 21:05:28 IST 2015,@AsdaServiceTeam Don't tell me that a superstore would have no salmon on fresh fish counter! This UK 2015 not USSR 1970 You remove chooses!!
creamytrumpet,Tue Jun 23 18:07:31 IST 2015,@AsdaServiceTeam They were unavailable online ie taken away as a choice. Furthermore why does Asda put things never bought in my favourites?
creamytrumpet,Tue Jun 23 16:46:26 IST 2015,RT @ThtGrlOnTheBike: Can you help find these two bikers from 'up north' who helped save another bikers life? http://t.co/ZRdU2m1qTy
creamytrumpet,Tue Jun 23 16:44:53 IST 2015,RT @AsdaServiceTeam: @haydn_fry Morning :) Did they show as unavailable on your order or were you not able to find them online at all? Thanâ€¦
creamytrumpet,Mon Jun 22 21:58:55 IST 2015,@AsdaServiceTeam No why all of  sudden can't get fish from fresh fish counter online? Why  withdraw stuff randomly after months? #illogical

creamytrumpet,Sun Jun 14 00:49:09 IST 2015,@thevanvan13 so when the fuckers randomly decide I don't need to eat fish anymore I get angry at prospect of 30 mile trip for a marine meal
creamytrumpet,Sun Jun 14 00:44:17 IST 2015,@thevanvan13 I live in Snowdonia 30 miles to nearest supermarket so home delivery is sensible option Asda best of the abysmal wanky bunch
creamytrumpet,Sat Jun 13 23:24:57 IST 2015,@AsdaServiceTeam why cant I buy from the fresh fish counter for home delivery? Could last week why do you reduce home delivery choice? Angry
creamytrumpet,Sat Jun 13 23:19:11 IST 2015,@asdaWhy all of a sudden is it impossible to buy fish from the fresh fish counter via home delivery? Another random move by the Asda numptys
