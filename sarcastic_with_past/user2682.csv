bob_abooee,Wed Feb 24 11:53:11 IST 2016,I can't tell you how thrilled I am that my timeline will be filled with politics for the next 8 months. #sarcasm
bob_abooee,Wed Feb 24 11:29:45 IST 2016,@ShirtlessCondum Do the old Ferris Bueller fake fever trick...lol
bob_abooee,Wed Feb 24 11:26:33 IST 2016,@Christianrache8 haha
bob_abooee,Wed Feb 24 11:24:10 IST 2016,"@pluckybrewster haha, people must of thought you were crazy."
bob_abooee,Wed Feb 24 11:18:47 IST 2016,I accidentally faved a tweet when I was cleaning off the screen of my iPad.
bob_abooee,Wed Feb 24 10:59:51 IST 2016,Nothing like a late night snack of S'mores.
bob_abooee,Wed Feb 24 09:08:46 IST 2016,"@assless_ash I was thinking it would be Jubilee, but she went out pretty early and kinda looked crazy near the end."
bob_abooee,Wed Feb 24 09:07:18 IST 2016,@SharonMacLean72 I liked Vanessa preseason and I couldn't stand her a few days in.
bob_abooee,Wed Feb 24 06:19:23 IST 2016,"@roxashiru yep I feel the same, it sucks having to wait every week now."
bob_abooee,Wed Feb 24 06:09:29 IST 2016,"@roxashiru good choice, the best episodes are actually in the past couple seasons IMO"
bob_abooee,Wed Feb 24 06:02:20 IST 2016,"@roxashiru Same, the beginning of season 2 just dragged."
bob_abooee,Wed Feb 24 06:01:03 IST 2016,@roxashiru I just binge watched the series in the past couple months. You're at the point where it's really going to get good.
bob_abooee,Wed Feb 24 05:56:27 IST 2016,"@VixenRogue haha, the only I didn't mind was the triple."
bob_abooee,Wed Feb 24 05:47:11 IST 2016,@bob_abooee Still a few more hours to go on this poll. Results are surprisingly close.
bob_abooee,Wed Feb 24 05:45:00 IST 2016,"@KatieLo17 Same, I'll just wait to see what they're like on the show"
bob_abooee,Wed Feb 24 05:44:36 IST 2016,@TVGal87 @iam_erika I lost horribly in my last BBUS draft. It's still pretty fun though
bob_abooee,Wed Feb 24 05:43:17 IST 2016,@KatieLo17 I don't even know any of them except Jase
bob_abooee,Wed Feb 24 05:42:21 IST 2016,"@iam_erika Yep, you always get players that you end up not liking...lol"
bob_abooee,Wed Feb 24 05:38:07 IST 2016,"I try not to pick any favorites when the cast is revealed, I like to see them play first. #BBCAN4"
bob_abooee,Wed Feb 24 05:30:41 IST 2016,@roxashiru What season are you on? I'm guessing this is the first time you're watching it through.
bob_abooee,Wed Feb 24 04:56:30 IST 2016,@assless_ash I think it will be Jojo and Lauren as the final 2
bob_abooee,Wed Feb 24 04:34:28 IST 2016,@assless_ash I actually thought it might be Caila that left. I don't know why he met Amanda's kids if he was unsure.
bob_abooee,Tue Feb 23 11:39:30 IST 2016,"@assless_ash I just finished The Bachelor, what did you think of who went home?"
bob_abooee,Tue Feb 23 11:38:08 IST 2016,"@yldrose That's what he said, not sure if that's actually true..lol"
bob_abooee,Tue Feb 23 11:36:51 IST 2016,@BabyD2034 I don't see the point of keeping the women with Children unless you really think they could be in your final 2 or 3
bob_abooee,Tue Feb 23 11:28:55 IST 2016,Ben's crying more than Amanda #TheBachelor
bob_abooee,Tue Feb 23 11:25:04 IST 2016,Ben really should have gotten rid of Amanda before he met her children. #TheBachelor
bob_abooee,Tue Feb 23 11:15:32 IST 2016,"@ShirtlessCondum same, strategy is the best part of Big Brother IMO."
bob_abooee,Tue Feb 23 11:13:18 IST 2016,Jojo's mother is the reasonable one in the family #TheBachelor
bob_abooee,Tue Feb 23 10:55:17 IST 2016,"@iam_erika haha, very true. Love any drama"
bob_abooee,Tue Feb 23 10:54:48 IST 2016,"By the previews, Ben's going to regret not running. #TheBachelor"
bob_abooee,Tue Feb 23 10:45:09 IST 2016,I can't believe the producers would dig up Jojo's ex boyfriend to cause drama on the show #TheBachelor
bob_abooee,Tue Feb 23 10:42:20 IST 2016,"@ssmithsstacy same. I think either this year or next is the last year of the good wife, will be sad to see it go."
bob_abooee,Tue Feb 23 10:41:10 IST 2016,@yldrose I could see that too
bob_abooee,Tue Feb 23 10:40:15 IST 2016,@ssmithsstacy she's one of the best guest stars on the show. I heard she might get a spinoff.
bob_abooee,Tue Feb 23 10:38:48 IST 2016,"@yldrose I hope she's not the one that leaves tonight, but I have a bad feeling she will."
bob_abooee,Tue Feb 23 10:29:38 IST 2016,"""Have you ever met Filipinos before?"" LMAO #TheBachelor"
bob_abooee,Tue Feb 23 10:15:28 IST 2016,@iamsheajenkins yeah that know killed the season for me. I actually think production gave Sarah the next HOH with the 100 min of hell comp
bob_abooee,Tue Feb 23 10:14:12 IST 2016,@iamsheajenkins that seems to be a popular write in vote...lol
bob_abooee,Tue Feb 23 10:13:41 IST 2016,"@iam_erika I agree, can't stand any type of coup d'Ã©tat based on popularity. I even hated it in Season 11, even though I liked Big Jeff."
bob_abooee,Tue Feb 23 10:08:05 IST 2016,"@fionagaallagher The only one I didn't mind is the triple, it was at least fair."
bob_abooee,Tue Feb 23 10:06:03 IST 2016,"@ShirtlessCondum haha, so true"
bob_abooee,Tue Feb 23 10:05:38 IST 2016,"@jorgebdamian that's the super power, and I agree that was definitely the worst"
bob_abooee,Tue Feb 23 10:04:39 IST 2016,"@BigSurvivors I agree, I went nuts when that power was given. Especially since Kevin was actually the first person to lift the floor tile."
bob_abooee,Tue Feb 23 10:02:19 IST 2016,@BigSurvivors Then you would pick the super power I'm guessing...lol.
bob_abooee,Tue Feb 23 10:01:06 IST 2016,Poll: What was the worst twist from BBCAN3?
bob_abooee,Tue Feb 23 09:43:25 IST 2016,Ben gets a dose of reality with a crying baby in the car #TheBachelor
bob_abooee,Tue Feb 23 09:36:10 IST 2016,Charlie leaves Ben hanging with the high five..lol #TheBachelor
bob_abooee,Tue Feb 23 06:46:35 IST 2016,"@assless_ash unfortunately I can't find a good stream tonight, I'll have to watch live in 3 hours"
bob_abooee,Tue Feb 23 06:25:36 IST 2016,@assless_ash It's hometown final 4 tonight right?
