DakMoyer,Sat Feb 27 04:43:04 IST 2016,Aguayo didn't run the 40? What is he trying to hide? Injury concerns? #sarcasm
DakMoyer,Sat Feb 27 04:07:15 IST 2016,"Remember, Cedric Ogbuehi was selected in the first round when it didn't look like he would play in 2015."
DakMoyer,Sat Feb 27 04:05:44 IST 2016,"Damn. This sucks to hear. Still think he'll get taken in the first, but perhaps in the 20-ish range now. https://t.co/0xGsrdJzQn"

DakMoyer,Sat Feb 27 01:44:45 IST 2016,Jaylon Smith at 223 shouldn't surprise anyone. 2016 is a redshirt year. He can regain that weight.
