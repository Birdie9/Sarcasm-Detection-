jeffcarp,Thu Feb 25 18:04:03 IST 2016,@karaswisher Since when do journalists cite opt-in surveys as news?  Did you read the PDF the NYT linked to? No Q or A on race. Hmm.
jeffcarp,Wed Feb 24 19:34:59 IST 2016,"When did citing an opt-in survey become newsworthy? When the ""results"" fit a journalist's narrative, that's when. @crtrud @crampell"

jeffcarp,Wed Feb 24 18:58:46 IST 2016,Yet your employer just wrote an article on Trump supporter's views on slavery citing a 2000 person opt-in survey @alexburnsNYT @fmanjoo
jeffcarp,Wed Feb 24 18:48:56 IST 2016,Why doesn't the PDF from YouGov that you linked to have the slavery Q/A in it that you wrote about? @vavreck @UpshotNYT
jeffcarp,Wed Feb 24 18:45:04 IST 2016,Really? It's an opt-in survey & the only source NYT linked to doesn't address the claim made in the article. Sloppy. @fmanjoo @ditzkoff
jeffcarp,Wed Feb 24 06:35:11 IST 2016,@copilotgps_us Is there a difference between CoPilot GPS Navigation (gray icon) & CoPilot Premium (red icon) in Android Play Store?
jeffcarp,Wed Feb 24 02:57:46 IST 2016,What a crazy world we live in when Verizon is talking about 5G in a year while CenturyLink is installing 1.5 Mpbs DSL in new homes today.
jeffcarp,Tue Feb 23 19:35:05 IST 2016,@caro_milanesi Their wellness program is diff from friends program. Corp wellness doesn't disclose individual results only team results.

jeffcarp,Sun Feb 21 21:04:22 IST 2016,@robpegoraro Did they remove the ability to edit the order that those settings appear in and drop others altogether?
jeffcarp,Thu Feb 18 19:03:18 IST 2016,That's a bit of a leap when the situation today is accessing one phone under court order. https://t.co/SK49zSjvMT @matthew_d_green @twbell
jeffcarp,Thu Feb 18 08:21:32 IST 2016,"Kind of tired of half-done @Android projects. Latest Wear massively drains watch battery,  watch finally notifies of call while on the call."
jeffcarp,Thu Feb 18 08:15:39 IST 2016,@waltmossberg That conclusion is a bit of a leap of logic.
jeffcarp,Thu Feb 18 05:39:18 IST 2016,It's not hard to imagine Apple / Google in the car game when you experience the ridiculous lack of tech knowledge most car salesman have.
jeffcarp,Mon Feb 15 02:01:55 IST 2016,@binarybits Back to leadership again rather than a pontificator. Or a Congress scared enough for their jobs that POTUS bully pulpit works.
jeffcarp,Mon Feb 15 01:52:20 IST 2016,@binarybits I don't see it in this election cycle. But see enough voters being fed up & searching for answers. That's a step.
jeffcarp,Mon Feb 15 01:23:35 IST 2016,@binarybits @mattyglesias need legitimate moderate leadership to tell bases of both parties to go to hell &  represent 75% of us not in base
jeffcarp,Mon Feb 15 01:22:21 IST 2016,@binarybits @mattyglesias Prob imo is base of both sides & politicians pandering to base's idiocy. Need legitimate center leaders.
jeffcarp,Mon Feb 15 01:20:41 IST 2016,@binarybits @mattyglesias Still a leadership issue. Strong exec / legis relationship negotiates before filibuster comes into play.
jeffcarp,Mon Feb 15 00:40:29 IST 2016,"@binarybits @mattyglesias Sorry,  don't understand that comment. Flip flopping of what?"

jeffcarp,Fri Feb 12 07:14:42 IST 2016,@googlemaps You need to give users a way to deny/delete #MyMaps that have been shared w/ users as spam.
jeffcarp,Fri Feb 12 01:35:53 IST 2016,@CenturyLinkHelp Thanks but I've checked & they're low. The most I can hope for is that competition forces a change. A shame it takes that.

jeffcarp,Wed Feb 10 20:55:57 IST 2016,@mims Defects in their technology becomes a tort liability case brought by insurance companies rather than an individual driver's insurance.
jeffcarp,Wed Feb 10 20:55:00 IST 2016,@mims Google has to prove to insurance companies that their technology is worthy of receiving that kind of preferential risk pool treatment.
jeffcarp,Wed Feb 10 20:53:25 IST 2016,@mims Autonomous drivers could all be in a different risk pool where the car owner's insurance company always pays for their own damage.

jeffcarp,Wed Jan 27 18:23:45 IST 2016,@jbrodkin That's irrelevant to the question of whether they are improving or declining.
jeffcarp,Wed Jan 27 07:34:36 IST 2016,"The best quarter Sprint has had in years is characterized as Sprint ""heading in the wrong direction"" by @jbrodkin? Huh?"
