jpendas1985,Fri Feb 26 23:22:45 IST 2016,@LindaSuhler even more reason to not vote for Trump. Christie ran as tea party and in the end stabbed Conservatives in the back #ChooseCruz

jpendas1985,Wed Feb 24 22:23:18 IST 2016,"@katscags62 bring the lawsuit and the outcome will prove my point that he is eligible. Still waiting for Trump to do it, but he won't lol"
jpendas1985,Wed Feb 24 22:20:08 IST 2016,@katscags62 no because his parents aren't American citizens
jpendas1985,Wed Feb 24 22:19:22 IST 2016,"@katscags62 Trump in the end Kathy is for what is good for him. Despite what you believe in the end its what's best for him, not the country"
jpendas1985,Wed Feb 24 22:18:31 IST 2016,@katscags62 In Iowa he said no subsidies for Ethanol; Trump wanted to increase subsidies so who's going to give people favors?
jpendas1985,Wed Feb 24 22:16:11 IST 2016,"@katscags62 so was John McCain not eligible to run? How about George Romney, Mitts dad? How about any soldier that has a kid born abroad?"
jpendas1985,Wed Feb 24 22:13:25 IST 2016,@katscags62 Koch Bros are behind Rubio not Cruz
jpendas1985,Wed Feb 24 22:12:01 IST 2016,@katscags62 wow I mean if your so indoctrinated to believe that he isn't then there is no hope
jpendas1985,Wed Feb 24 22:11:02 IST 2016,@katscags62 if you are child of American citizen born abroad you are a naturalized citizen that is a fact
jpendas1985,Wed Feb 24 22:08:51 IST 2016,@katscags62 again his donors are heavily pro constitution not pro amnesty.  If you want to believe Trumps lies go ahead but it is a lie
jpendas1985,Wed Feb 24 22:07:37 IST 2016,"@katscags62 I want the us to go to the Constitution, one man cannot fix mess were in especially if he is not principled constitutionalist"
jpendas1985,Wed Feb 24 22:06:20 IST 2016,"@katscags62 All I can say is we will lose the country if Trump is the nominee, he is totalitarian in nature & unfavorable nationally"
jpendas1985,Wed Feb 24 22:04:46 IST 2016,"@katscags62 He is a natural born American and any court that you bring a suit up against will agree, its why Trump hasn't brought the suit"
jpendas1985,Wed Feb 24 22:03:47 IST 2016,@katscags62 pro amnesty donors aren't backing Cruz.  Read @michellemalkin book Sold Out it goes over the corruption in Washington
jpendas1985,Wed Feb 24 22:00:22 IST 2016,@katscags62 I don't excuse that at all but that involves LEGAL immigration not illegal immigration #ChooseCruz #CruzCrew
jpendas1985,Wed Feb 24 21:57:58 IST 2016,@katscags62 How do we know if he shows up to work? Being a good businessman does not mean you'll be a good POTUS; look up Herbert Hoover
jpendas1985,Wed Feb 24 21:57:02 IST 2016,"@katscags62 oh yes because back in 2013 Trump took the heat during the Gang of 8 debate right?  Oh wait he actually supported it,wow shocker"
jpendas1985,Wed Feb 24 21:55:54 IST 2016,@katscags62 its doesn't excuse it.  Your providing an excuse for someone who has hired illegal workers which hurts American workers
jpendas1985,Wed Feb 24 21:54:58 IST 2016,"@katscags62 he's not only one to say that, Cruz & Paul went further & proposed bill that would block refugees coming frm certain countries"
jpendas1985,Wed Feb 24 21:52:45 IST 2016,"@katscags62 Sorry but Trump isn't responsible for his rise to solicitor general of Texas or US Senator, He stands on his own accomplishments"
jpendas1985,Wed Feb 24 21:51:10 IST 2016,@katscags62 they don't have to be illegal immigrants.  You know there are legal immigrants & American citizens that speak multiple languages
jpendas1985,Wed Feb 24 21:50:18 IST 2016,@katscags62 problem is he changes based on what is politically expedient not based on a longstanding belief in those newfound principles
jpendas1985,Wed Feb 24 21:49:18 IST 2016,@katscags62 go back to 2011 Cruz in an interview describes the plan Trump has now adopted so no he didn't get it from Trump lol
jpendas1985,Wed Feb 24 21:47:53 IST 2016,@katscags62 I have read his plan and I've listened to what he says and it is very contradictory to his written plan
jpendas1985,Wed Feb 24 21:47:15 IST 2016,@katscags62 he also employs illegal immigrants so I find it very unlikely he will enforce all this immigration policy he speaks of
jpendas1985,Wed Feb 24 21:46:24 IST 2016,@katscags62 there are laws in place that require penalties where you can't apply for citizenship if you have been here legally
