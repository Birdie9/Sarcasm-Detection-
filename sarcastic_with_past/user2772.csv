IshLaRaza,Sat Jun 27 04:34:23 IST 2015,"@moser_kristen exactly,  why make it seem like gays are taking over your neighborhoods. Hide yo wives, hide yo kids #sarcastic"
IshLaRaza,Sat Jun 27 04:32:28 IST 2015,"@moser_kristen some churches even had and have ""treatments"" to cure such people. Some consider that torture."
IshLaRaza,Sat Jun 27 04:30:41 IST 2015,"@moser_kristen LGBT people have also been injured and killed for being gay and showing their ""gayness"" in public, come on now."
IshLaRaza,Sat Jun 27 04:28:14 IST 2015,@moser_kristen just making the point that both issues used the same argument to keep a way of life for most and deny a freedom for a few.
IshLaRaza,Sat Jun 27 04:23:53 IST 2015,"@moser_kristen it was a terroristic mindset that kept slaves with their ""families"""
IshLaRaza,Sat Jun 27 04:23:09 IST 2015,"@moser_kristen very few slaves were actually murdered because of their economic value and some slaves were never ""tortured"""
IshLaRaza,Sat Jun 27 04:21:17 IST 2015,"@moser_kristen yes it is, ""the south"" used the same argument that it was a state issue and that it would destroy southern economy"
IshLaRaza,Sat Jun 27 04:17:44 IST 2015,@moser_kristen they were (notice it's past tense) both civil rights issues
IshLaRaza,Sat Jun 27 04:07:21 IST 2015,@moser_kristen got it. I just think it's selfish for people (maybe not you) to put their political views above others civil rights
IshLaRaza,Sat Jun 27 03:59:57 IST 2015,"@moser_kristen why do you have a need for other people not to marry, it's not like they are having gay sex on your front lawn."
IshLaRaza,Sat Jun 27 03:56:49 IST 2015,"So you saying if a state wanted to bring back slavery, that should be okay. This not a state's right issue, it's individual rights"
IshLaRaza,Sat Jun 27 03:53:07 IST 2015,"@moser_kristen, very true. So if your church marries gays and you don't like it, go to another church."
IshLaRaza,Sat Jun 27 03:51:21 IST 2015,"@moser_kristen maybe after woman get equal pay in the workplace #EqualityForAll
