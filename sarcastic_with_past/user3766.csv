hotts58,Sun Apr 12 05:00:46 IST 2015,@1500ESPN_Reusse Pelfrey with a solid 1:1 HR:K ratio and a solid 7.20 ERA.  He didn't get outpitched in spring training by Milone. #Twins
hotts58,Sat Apr 11 06:27:16 IST 2015,20 doubles given up this year by the #Brewers.  4 games
hotts58,Sat Apr 11 04:43:01 IST 2015,Great way to end the game for #TwinsWin!
hotts58,Sat Apr 11 04:32:52 IST 2015,@Chris_Liss Is ass or whole - ass better or worse than half ass?  I can't remember
hotts58,Sat Apr 11 04:29:59 IST 2015,@joe_sheehan Twins are doing their part obviously. ...
hotts58,Sat Apr 11 04:19:14 IST 2015,@DanBarreiroKFAN Not bad for Sam Fuld trade return.  Now Pelfrey will keep that going tomorrow I'm sure. #momentum #Twins #SARCASM
hotts58,Fri Apr 10 23:11:33 IST 2015,@DanBarreiroKFAN They'll probably score 5 runs in the first inning today.
hotts58,Fri Apr 10 05:58:06 IST 2015,@BaseballGuys Greene scored less than a point off Matt Harvey in my 2 points leagues.  Need it after sitting Jake Odorizzi
hotts58,Fri Apr 10 05:54:13 IST 2015,"@BaseballGuys @TheHall98 Greene will not face the Twins every day, but still likely to see them a few times yet. Twins 1 run all season"
hotts58,Fri Apr 10 05:45:58 IST 2015,@gregorMLB @BaseballGuys Even fantasy owners usually give you at least one more chance.
hotts58,Thu Apr 09 22:35:32 IST 2015,"@ProFootballTalk I bet that she gets treated with more respect, from coaches, than her male counterpart across the field."
hotts58,Thu Apr 09 21:49:10 IST 2015,@thereallisaann One month and one day until mine!  May birthdays know how special it is!  :)
hotts58,Thu Apr 09 21:18:51 IST 2015,"@SiriusXMFantasy Liss is right, I hate hearing ""he needs a blow.""  The rest of the world says ""a rest"" or ""break"" in sports it's ""a blow."""
hotts58,Thu Apr 09 21:14:50 IST 2015,@SiriusXMFantasy Ausmus is likely just talking about the runs he plans to score today.

hotts58,Wed Apr 08 02:05:49 IST 2015,@SXM_Help yes I tried that and still nothing
hotts58,Wed Apr 08 00:09:12 IST 2015,@SXM_Help it says it is expired.

hotts58,Sat Apr 04 00:50:10 IST 2015,@BerniePleskoff Is Wandy now on waivers or is he a free agent?
hotts58,Fri Apr 03 17:03:04 IST 2015,@BaseballAmerica Same guy that used to play for the Cubs?  Are his concussions no longer an issue?
hotts58,Fri Apr 03 04:43:43 IST 2015,"@SethTweets Ricky Nolasco's ceiling is ""mediocre veteran"" and that's not how he is being paid."
hotts58,Fri Apr 03 04:40:58 IST 2015,@scott_pianowski The content not the count is all that matters.  Be concise and accurate.  Count hasn't mattered since grade school.
hotts58,Fri Apr 03 04:02:06 IST 2015,"@CraigMish Craig,  is Anthony DeSclafani worth rostering in my 10 team league?  He's been pretty good this spring but what say you? Thanks"

hotts58,Thu Apr 02 05:45:01 IST 2015,@BaseballGuys Happy Birthday to the Oracle! #BestDayEver
hotts58,Thu Apr 02 02:39:27 IST 2015,@scott_pianowski Plus these folks are just guessing.  Do they even know the problem?  Not like he re-injured it in spring training right?
hotts58,Wed Apr 01 07:11:31 IST 2015,@LaVelleNeal What more does Eduardo Escobar have to do to be an everyday player? Seems like he has been consistently producing for a year.
hotts58,Wed Apr 01 06:13:05 IST 2015,@YahooSports Would be karma if all other bodies that could play 3B got hurt prior to the date Cubs plan to call him up.  #BaseballDecisionBS
hotts58,Fri Mar 27 18:48:41 IST 2015,@SiriusXMFantasy Theo is slowing the roll.  What if Bryant comes up and struggles or gets hurt? Cubs still not all that but expected to win.
hotts58,Fri Mar 27 07:00:40 IST 2015,@SethTweets I'm sure that was a great seat the rest of the flight too.  #RestroomSmell
hotts58,Tue Mar 24 18:15:30 IST 2015,RT @RhettBollinger: #MNTwins sign Brian Dozier to a four-year extension worth $20 million
hotts58,Tue Mar 24 07:05:22 IST 2015,@YahooSports Wow.  That pretty much sums it up for me.  Did he lose a bet or what? #AdrianPetersonCamel
hotts58,Tue Mar 24 06:59:44 IST 2015,@adbrandt that is the lamest thing ever!
hotts58,Tue Mar 24 06:58:47 IST 2015,@DanBarreiroKFAN Have you ever ridden in on an ox to be gored?  That has @DanBarreiroKFAN birthday written all over it! #birthdayox
hotts58,Tue Mar 24 06:52:57 IST 2015,@DraftCountdown Looks the part until he starts to play the game.  I don't want my @Vikings to have him on their radar.
hotts58,Tue Mar 24 06:22:38 IST 2015,"@BaseballGuys come on Ray, join the dark side!  Bryant has a floor of Mike Trout production. :-)"
hotts58,Tue Mar 24 06:12:14 IST 2015,@BaseballGuys @baseballin77 Did I miss the Cervelli to the Rockies trade?  Not a10 HR bat
hotts58,Tue Mar 24 05:48:11 IST 2015,@scott_pianowski Why?  I prefer to have a guy who is dominant be worth something rather then just blindly reward the 9th inning guy.
hotts58,Tue Mar 24 05:46:37 IST 2015,"@andybehrens @scott_pianowski pay for saves,  don't pay for a stiff."
hotts58,Tue Mar 24 05:44:46 IST 2015,"@scott_pianowski saves/holds is a much better category than just saves, but in saves only,  get a stud."
hotts58,Tue Mar 24 04:47:12 IST 2015,@WCCORosen   AP did the crime and the time. Vikings will come out of this smelling like roses rather than cutting him to save cap space.
hotts58,Mon Mar 23 03:00:58 IST 2015,RT @SiriusXMFantasy: SHOCKINGLY @CraigMish is going against the Experts when it comes to the #Cubs Kris Bryant.  He says go ALL IN! RT If Yâ€¦
hotts58,Sun Mar 22 09:46:14 IST 2015,@JoePisapia17 Bryant it is.  Just could not live with being able to have him for 20 years and not take it.
hotts58,Sat Mar 21 20:27:01 IST 2015,"@JoePisapia17 Stupid to keep Hamels instead of Bryant, who I could keep his whole career?  H2H points already have Max, Greinke and Goldy"

hotts58,Fri Mar 20 08:14:42 IST 2015,3 minutes of trying to watch March Madness and sick of it already.  4 games and ALL 4 on commercial breaks. #MarchMadness
