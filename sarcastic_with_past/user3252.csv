Lizemery,Sun May 24 18:06:29 IST 2015,If we do a mass rain dance and aim it at #MonacoGP it might make it exciting?!
Lizemery,Sun May 24 18:05:51 IST 2015,"RT @GrandPrixDiary: Bit of excitement needed soon, at the moment this is like the Spanish Grand Prix but with more buildings and boats."
Lizemery,Sun May 24 18:05:07 IST 2015,What a surprise the #MonacoGP is boring!

Lizemery,Fri May 22 20:38:23 IST 2015,For excited about the @FIAformulaE again this weekend then @F1 . COME ON @Amlin_Aguri time for another win don't you think?!
Lizemery,Sun May 17 14:04:59 IST 2015,"So the @WWE divas title is not up for grabs again? Surprise, surprise! I don't mind @BellaTwins being champion but please be a fighting one!"

Lizemery,Wed Apr 29 10:58:34 IST 2015,So happy to wake up this morning in the grey UK to the news we have a new king. All hail King @WadeBarrett long live the King!

Lizemery,Tue Apr 28 17:35:26 IST 2015,"Sorry for the whole #GiveDivasAChance rant but it really bugs me, @WWE had its chance to do something different on Sunday and they failed"
Lizemery,Tue Apr 28 17:33:16 IST 2015,This also means the amazing female talent that is building in @WWENXT will have a future in the @WWE main roaster! #GiveDivasAChance
Lizemery,Tue Apr 28 17:32:09 IST 2015,"It would give @WWE creative team much more to work with, the crowds wont be bored with the same matches over and over. #GiveDivasAChance"
Lizemery,Tue Apr 28 17:29:20 IST 2015,"I don't care if the matches are then only 10 minutes, I would rather see 2 good 10 minutes match then a boring 15 min #GiveDivasAChance"
Lizemery,Tue Apr 28 17:28:19 IST 2015,At least this would mean you would a least have 6 female wrestlers getting air time and championship opportunities. #GiveDivasAChance
Lizemery,Tue Apr 28 17:27:33 IST 2015,Turn the @WWE Divas title into a tag team title and then bring back the @WWE women's championship back. #GiveDivasAChance
Lizemery,Tue Apr 28 17:25:24 IST 2015,The big problem is they only have 1 @WWE title belt to be fighting over and generally 1 match a night. Not much time to #GiveDivasAChance
Lizemery,Tue Apr 28 17:23:08 IST 2015,"@WWE have good female wrestlers at the moment, and lots who have potential if given the chance. #GiveDivasAChance"
Lizemery,Tue Apr 28 17:21:17 IST 2015,Its the lack of story that annoys me most at the moment in @WWE Diva division #GiveDivasAChance has helped but not enough as it's so limited
Lizemery,Tue Apr 28 17:18:39 IST 2015,I dont mind getting angry at results as clearly the plot has worked as I care enough to have an opinion. #WWE
Lizemery,Tue Apr 28 17:17:25 IST 2015,The more I watch @WWE the more frustrated I get with the character turns and lack of storylines behind some characters. #wwe
