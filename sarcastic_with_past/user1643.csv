JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 23:48:35 IST 2016,The Blackhawks have signed Mac Carruth and traded for Drew MacIntyre the past few days. Clearly gearing up to trade Corey Crawford. #sarcasm
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 20:14:27 IST 2016,"""Astonishing"" isn't the word I'd use. Probably one of the many synonyms for ""stupid"".  https://t.co/HLK8GtERMz"
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 09:47:17 IST 2016,I've been meaning to reread Joe Biden's autobiography. Talk about a great inspiration.
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 09:45:58 IST 2016,This moment is ludicrously powerful. Just....wow.
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 09:43:17 IST 2016,"Mr. Vice President. If you won't reconsider and run for president, then please PLEASE host the Oscars next year. You'd be amazing at it."
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 01:40:51 IST 2016,"Solemn vow: I will make it to an NWHL game next year. Preferably in Boston (Knight is the absolute best), but I'm not picky."
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 01:22:43 IST 2016,"Not often that Crawford makes a really bad play, but that was one. Have to seal that post. No excuse."
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 01:12:23 IST 2016,What a play by Richard Panik. In one motion wins a puck battle and fires a pass to Rasmussen for the goal. Gorgeous stuff.
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 01:07:04 IST 2016,Well played Shaw.
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 01:05:51 IST 2016,"Curious how officials didn't tag Toews with an elbowing penalty there. Wasn't intentional, but still definitely worth a call."
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:48:19 IST 2016,"@RobertZeglinski I'm not there. Get to go for a few weeks, but the beats are killing me right now. I love spring in Arizona."
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:44:27 IST 2016,@JayZawaski670 @The1Tab @MattSpiegel670 Like when they had the rentals in last year and brought back Desjardins.
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:44:02 IST 2016,The downside of being a baseball writer: long season with tons of travel. Upside: spending a month and a half in Florida or Arizona.
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:42:26 IST 2016,@_adamhess Not at all. The only time he's ever badly misused is when he's at left wing. He stinks there.
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:42:03 IST 2016,@MattSpiegel670 Probably a good idea. He's the best fit in terms of being replaceable AND being able to demand a high draft pick or two.
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:39:38 IST 2016,"@MattSpiegel670 And also can't forget that Panarin has bonuses kicking in that will up his contract, along w/ Seabs & Anisimov extensions."
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:39:19 IST 2016,@MattSpiegel670 He's way more likely to sign a cheaper deal when he hits restricted free agency than Andrew Shaw too. Good to keep him.
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:37:59 IST 2016,"@_adamhess That being said, he could certainly have an impact at top line right wing if the spot was open, but that's not his job this year."
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:37:37 IST 2016,@_adamhess The problem certainly was that he can't create enough offense from a bottom six RW spot. Center gives him more freedom.
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:32:10 IST 2016,We need to discuss this visor/sock/van combo. Joe Maddon is everyone's awesome uncle.  https://t.co/KM8YL4voJo
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:30:22 IST 2016,@mutt0311 He was in Colorado yesterday for the outdoor game.
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:28:24 IST 2016,"That angle of attack by Teuvo really made that play. Holtby had to not only find him through traffic, but couldn't cheat to the far post."
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:19:46 IST 2016,"@MarkLazerus I suppose it's better than being the Ben Carson of Twitter, where you say terrible things and no one cares."
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:18:53 IST 2016,@MarkLazerus You're a monster and you must be stopped.
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:17:27 IST 2016,@ChristopherHine @SportsCentre I always have to click on it to make sure. Kind of like any Bob McKenzie tweet.
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:16:12 IST 2016,"@ChristopherHine @MarkLazerus Well, that's Staal she wrote."
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:08:04 IST 2016,It's going to be very odd to see Eric Staal in another uniform.
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:07:06 IST 2016,"@MattEurich @JayZawaski670 Jay is the brains of the operation, and I just occasionally say smart things. He's Toews. I'm Shaw."
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:05:11 IST 2016,@JayZawaski670 It looks like he and Teravainen may have something going. Look like they complement one another.
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:03:52 IST 2016,"@mattlindner I think Caps vs. LA, CHI, or DAL would be a blast."
JamesNeveau,Sun Feb 28 23:58:36 IST 2016,"@Slaughter_Rule Fun story: watching the game with my mom and sister. Laughed and said ""yeah. Really helped them against the Habs."""
JamesNeveau,Sun Feb 28 23:57:46 IST 2016,@19JToews Just completely vacated the zone there. Probably not a good plan when Patrick Kane is involved.
JamesNeveau,Sun Feb 28 23:56:12 IST 2016,Just loved the awareness by van Riemsdyk on the pass interception that led to Kane's goal. Lightning quick decision to find Kane and pass.
JamesNeveau,Sun Feb 28 21:49:55 IST 2016,"I'd give an analogy for what this #Arsenal season has been like, but it would be graphic and/or full of profanity."
JamesNeveau,Sun Feb 28 11:36:45 IST 2016,I can't get over how comical it is that the Warriors have clinched a playoff spot. It's only February.
JamesNeveau,Sat Feb 27 23:30:12 IST 2016,@schatzipage I simply can't imagine a world where it's viewed as a good idea to let the postal service die. It's incredibly important
JamesNeveau,Sat Feb 27 23:29:33 IST 2016,@schatzipage They want Congress to act to keep the price the same. The last increase was only scheduled to last two years.
JamesNeveau,Sat Feb 27 22:57:53 IST 2016,"As an avid letter writer, I have mixed feelings on this: the price of stamps could go down for first time in 97 yrs https://t.co/twGsY8Z7Kp"
JamesNeveau,Sat Feb 27 22:50:02 IST 2016,Jiri Sekac has been claimed on waivers by the Coyotes. Second time this year the Hawks have lost a player to Arizona on waivers (Tikhonov)
JamesNeveau,Sat Feb 27 22:45:24 IST 2016,"@SputnikAZ According to Cap Friendly, Sekac puts them at 50. @rossdelliott"
JamesNeveau,Sat Feb 27 09:52:47 IST 2016,"@KeyboardKeith66 @AlCimaglia Ladd seems to think so. Doubt it's him, but as we saw with Desjardins, anything is possible."
JamesNeveau,Sat Feb 27 09:44:21 IST 2016,"@GregZajac1 I get the sense he's still got his ears open, but he's in no rush. Q likes the defense as is (although I still have ?s)"
JamesNeveau,Sat Feb 27 09:09:02 IST 2016,@Adam_PHN I think if he wasn't part of the long-term plan they wouldn't have extended him. Definitely something to watch though.
JamesNeveau,Sat Feb 27 09:03:51 IST 2016,"@HeyMyNameIsWill A decent prospect (not great, but solid) for two rentals? And a second round pick? Fair trade all around it would seem."
JamesNeveau,Sat Feb 27 09:03:15 IST 2016,@Sean_P_White @chrismpeters I think my expectation was top four. Still has time to develop though. I need to be more patient.
JamesNeveau,Sat Feb 27 09:00:24 IST 2016,"@Steve_Dangle With how well the Hawks have done in attracting foreign and college guys, they'll still be around to make you nervous. :)"
JamesNeveau,Sat Feb 27 08:58:01 IST 2016,This cannot be overstated. Great point by Al. Should help ease the transition too.  https://t.co/QesKoA4OoI
JamesNeveau,Sat Feb 27 08:57:25 IST 2016,"@chrismpeters @Sean_P_White I'd defer to Sean on this, but I feel like TVR hasn't developed the way I wanted him to this year."
JamesNeveau,Sat Feb 27 08:56:43 IST 2016,"@benhtallman Absolutely. Not sure if he'll be here this year, but he's coming. And he looks really solid."
JamesNeveau,Sat Feb 27 08:56:12 IST 2016,@ScottyHockey I think he's a really good player and one of the best draft picks Bowman has made.
