LeftBordigist,Tue Feb 16 06:19:10 IST 2016,"ha, I've just clogged up the #leftcom tag"

LeftBordigist,Tue Feb 16 05:54:53 IST 2016,"are there any actual #leninists anymore? like, as in #leninists who just like lenin whilst thinking #trotsky and #stalin were shite?"
LeftBordigist,Tue Feb 16 05:54:03 IST 2016,"because they're normally either: #socialdemocrat, #leftliberal, #tankie or #trotskyite"
LeftBordigist,Tue Feb 16 05:53:10 IST 2016,"the sad thing about being a #leftcom is that in the past when I saw someone call themselves a #socialist I was like ""cool""! Now: #suspicion"
LeftBordigist,Tue Feb 16 05:50:55 IST 2016,"have y'all seen the agorist 'class theory', it's fucking wild https://t.co/DE0yT2xg8O"
LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 08:23:14 IST 2016,"anyway, I don't have enough money to get #RedRosa, which should tell you just how much #money i currently have"
LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 08:21:11 IST 2016,the #bank care about my security. #capitalism really does work :)
LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 08:17:55 IST 2016,"only really got cliff's #statecapitalist theory secondhand through #aufheben, but god it sounds #awful"
LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 08:16:30 IST 2016,and her #economic works
LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 08:16:21 IST 2016,"but like, I really need to get #reformorrevolution"
LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 08:16:06 IST 2016,I really need to read more #luxemburg. I've got a nice secondhand copy of #TheMassStrike. fucking tony cliff wrote the introduction
LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 08:13:48 IST 2016,"but rather than #hegel, my #criticaltheory will be based on #edmundburke"
LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 08:12:19 IST 2016,I'm a #criticaltheorist in training
LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 08:12:05 IST 2016,"it's meant lightheartedly though, I like #criticaltheory a bunch"
LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 08:11:48 IST 2016,who can't seem to admit that #zizek has became a real #rightist
LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 08:11:28 IST 2016,that's a joke for the #criticaltheory crowd
LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 08:11:17 IST 2016,we need a #zizek of the #left
LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 08:09:13 IST 2016,"then there's the idea that #leninism inevitably leads to #stalinism, which is quite a nondialectical position"
LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 08:08:27 IST 2016,Like I still dislike #Lenin a lot but with most anarchists he's treated as being as bad as #stalin
LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 08:08:01 IST 2016,one of the good things about being a #leftcom is being able to take a more ambiguous position on #Lenin
LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 08:07:17 IST 2016,he cites #lenin a lot but lenin was a pretty good #dialectician so I can't complain too much
LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 08:05:48 IST 2016,#MartinGlaberman's critique of #Mao's #dialectics is fucking solid https://t.co/YNyjj6CmPx
LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 08:04:54 IST 2016,either way I like them a lot
LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 08:04:45 IST 2016,the #johnsonforesttendency were #trots but they seem heterodox enough that i more or less see them as #leftcoms
LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 08:02:15 IST 2016,more #factdriven than #theory driven but that works for what it's about
LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 08:01:53 IST 2016,from what I understand Davis is an #ML but the book is really good either way
LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 08:01:31 IST 2016,answer: yes
LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 08:01:25 IST 2016,"oh, and also Angela Davis' Are Prisons Obsolete?"

LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 07:57:04 IST 2016,"but to clarify in case, I do not actually support the assassination of bernie sanders"
LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 07:56:46 IST 2016,"haha, thank god for this semi-anonymity"
LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 07:56:30 IST 2016,if that's not a good reason to assassinate him I don't know what is
LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 07:56:09 IST 2016,fucking sanders supports isreal
LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 07:55:16 IST 2016,"okay, i guess the term is #fucked"
LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 07:55:07 IST 2016,you can use it like #wolff and have it refer to #coops
LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 07:54:54 IST 2016,often it's used as a synonym for #socialdemocracy (vomits) but it doesn't have to be that way
LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 07:54:24 IST 2016,I don't even fucking like #democraticsocialism but it deserves better than this
LeftBordigist,Mon Feb 15 07:54:05 IST 2016,hahahahhahahahahaha *dies*
